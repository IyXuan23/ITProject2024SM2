        "The Graduate Certificate in Design for Health and Wellbeing introduces concepts including why space matters, spatial research methods and how users\u2019 health and wellbeing are impacted by their environments. Design practice will enable learners to put theory into practice guided by evidence-based insights. Students will be equipped with the skills needed to brief and critically evaluate the spaces that we inhabit and impact our health and wellbeing; and interpret and critique visual communication techniques in various forms, including plans, sketch models, and 3D digital renderings. Students will be encouraged to develop strong written, oral and visual communication skills within the core subjects.",
        "This course is intended for both designers and non-designers. For many students, including design professionals, the specific approaches used in designing for health and wellbeing will be new and or possibly misunderstood. This course will introduce the principles and processes of user-experience (UX), design thinking and evidence-based design to enable students to correctly and creatively apply these concepts to design problems within their own contexts. The collaborative nature of this course, will allow students to work in interdisciplinary design teams of designers and non-designers, drawing on their diverse skills, knowledge and interests to enrichen the design process and enhance the end design product.",
