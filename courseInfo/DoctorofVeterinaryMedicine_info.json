This will allow for the early introduction of an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to veterinary studies, an approach that provides opportunities for students to apply their understanding to authentic cases, to practise evidence-based decision-making, to solve clinical problems and to acquire clinical competencies in an ordered and sequential way, from the first year of their course. By the time they reach the final year of the DVM, students will be immersed in a community of best practice in veterinary clinics, where the explicit teaching of the lecture theatre, practical class and tutorial room gives way to peer to peer teaching and experiential learning.",

Students who complete the course requirements of the DVM program are eligible to apply for registration as a veterinary practitioner within Australia and New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.",
            "Students enrolled in the DVM course must develop the necessary skills to register as veterinary practitioners with theVeterinary Practitioners Registration Board of Victoria.  The course is designed to educate students on the foundation of knowledge, attitude, skills and behaviours that are required in veterinary practice.  Certain inherent requirements must be demonstrated by students in order to progress through the curriculum and ultimately receive the DVM degree, the qualification that provides the basis of a person\u2019s application for registration to practise.",
            "The University of Melbourne and the Melbourne Veterinary School are committed to supporting students to pursue a veterinary education and to achieve both their potential and their career objectives.  The School is committed to making reasonable adjustments to teaching and learning, assessments, clinical practice and other activities to address the impact of students' disabilities and personal circumstances so that they are able to participate and succeed in the course.",
            "The School has developed a series of Inherent Requirement statements as a guide for prospective and current students.  These statements specify the requirements of the DVM program for student admission and progression.  The statements are clustered under eight domains: ethical behaviour, behavioural stability, legal, communication, cognition, sensory abilities, strength and mobility, and health and sustainable performance.",

These staff members can work collaboratively with you to determine whether reasonable adjustments can be made to assist you to meet the Inherent Requirements.",
            "Students should note that a reasonable adjustment may include modification to assessment and the provision of additional support services, but the University cannot make an adjustment which would compromise the academic integrity of the DVM course or human or animal safety.  Part of the DVM course takes place at clinical sites off-campus where it may not be possible for either the University or placement host to make the same reasonable adjustments that are possible on campus.  This means that having a disability which prevents training in a particular context may preclude completion of course requirements and therefore prevent progression to practice.",
            "Once enrolled in the DVM course, students with a disability are encouraged to register with the Student Equity and Disability Support as early as possible.  The role of this service is to negotiate reasonable adjustments, following consultations with students and staff of the School, and to provide information and advice to students in this context.  If it is determined that inherent requirements cannot be met with reasonable adjustments, the University staff can provide guidance regarding other study options.",
