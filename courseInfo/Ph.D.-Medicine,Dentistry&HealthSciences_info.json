        "The degree of Doctor of Philosophy signifies that the holder has undertaken a substantial piece of original research, which has been conducted and reported by the holder via the thesis, under proper academic supervision and in a research environment for a prescribed period.",
        "The PhD thesis demonstrates authority in the candidate's field and shows evidence of command of knowledge in relevant fields. It shows that the candidate has a thorough grasp of the appropriate methodological techniques and an awareness of their limitations. The thesis makes a distinct contribution to knowledge. Its contribution to knowledge rests on originality of approach and / or interpretation of the findings and, in some cases, the discovery of new facts. The thesis demonstrates an ability to communicate research findings effectively in the professional arena and in an international context. It is a careful, rigorous and sustained piece of work demonstrating that a research 'apprenticeship' is complete and the holder is admitted to the community of scholars in the discipline. In scope, the PhD thesis differs from a research Masters thesis chiefly by its deeper and more comprehensive treatment of the chosen subject. It is written succinctly, in English, unless approval has been given for the thesis to be written in a language other than English. All candidates for the degree will be examined on the basis of their thesis which is examined externally. The normal length of the thesis is between 80,000 and 100,000 words, exclusive of words in tables, maps, bibliographies and appendices.",

The coursework consists of a structured 4-week program normally taken in the first month of candidature. Through a series of built-in assessment tasks, the coursework facilitates progression to confirmation. The program aims to teach essential theoretical concepts and facilitate the understanding of specialised literature. Key areas of contemporary neuroscience research provide a focus for developing advanced research skills and integrating this new multi-disciplinary knowledge into the research project from the start of candidature.",

Any graduate researcher undertaking a PhD that engages the neurosciences is potentially eligible for participation in this coursework. Subject selection should be discussed with the Supervisor and with the Course Convenor (Dr Kathy Lefevere-Burd) and should also include discussion as to whether successful completion of the coursework will form part of the requirements for confirmation. The coursework is a confirmation requirement for all graduate researchers enrolled through the Florey Department of Neuroscience and Mental Health, unless exceptional circumstances apply. Students seeking exemption may apply to the Course Convenor who will seek approval from the Director, Florey Department of Neuroscience and Mental Health. Applications for exemption must be submitted before the subject selection's application deadline. To select subjects, graduate researchers should complete the Subject Selection Form available from the Course Convenor. The approval of the Supervisor, Head of Department/School and the Course Convenor is required. For PhD students of the Melbourne Schools of Engineering and Science, Faculty approval should also be sought. Contact the relevant Faculty.",
