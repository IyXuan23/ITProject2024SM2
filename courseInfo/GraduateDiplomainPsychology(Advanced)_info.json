        "Psychology is a broad and intellectually fascinating scientific discipline with a focus on understanding behaviour and experience, particularly in humans. The science of psychology involves a wide range of perspectives and approaches, with psychological research findings having important applications in areas such as health, education, business and commerce, as well as informing us about how human behaviours and motivations relate to a wide range of societal issues.",
        "The Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences\u2019Graduate Diploma in Psychology (Advanced)is accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) as a pathway for graduates of other disciplines, who have subsequently been awarded the equivalent of an undergraduate major in psychology, to complete an accredited fourth year in psychology.",
        "An APAC accredited fourth year in Psychology is a prerequisite for the further studies in Psychology that are required to register as a practicing psychologist; it is also the recommended pathway for students wishing to undertake a higher research degree in Psychology to pursue a career in psychological research.",
        "The Graduate Diploma in Psychology (Advanced) has been designed to build on the knowledge and skills attained in the APAC accredited Graduate Diploma in Psychology. The course provides students with flexibility and choice in advanced coursework in the core discipline areas of Psychology, as well as an opportunity to undertake advanced training in the conduct of a significant research project, and to develop pre-professional knowledge of the ethical principles and assessment and interviewing skills that underpin further professional training as a psychologist.",
        "Note: The Graduate Diploma in Psychology (Advanced) is identical in content and assessment to the Psychology Honours program (via the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science). However, the two programs differ in their award requirements. Honours students require a minimum overall mark of 65% to be awarded the degree, whereas Graduate Diploma in Psychology (Advanced) students require a minimum overall mark of 50%. The academic results obtained through both courses are considered equivalent for those intending to undertake further study.",
