        "The clinical neuropsychology program at the University of Melbourne commenced in the 1970s and aims to provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary for competent practice in relation to a variety of diagnostic problems and management issues. The acquisition of professional skills at a sophisticated level is the ultimate goal of the program. The program enjoys an excellent reputation as one of the premier clinical neuropsychology programs in the country and produces graduates with a detailed understanding of the affective, behavioural and cognitive manifestations of diseases of the central nervous system, particularly those affecting the brain, in adults and children. Graduates acquire competence in various approaches to the study of brain disease, including basic and applied clinical sciences, and are expected to acquire an understanding of culturally responsive, objective assessment of the many behavioural features of brain diseases that can present across the lifespan.",
        "The course is accredited by theAustralian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC),providing the required sequence of subjects for graduates wishing to attain generalist registration as a psychologist in Australia as well as competency in knowledge and skills relevant to the clinical neuropsychology specialisation.",
        "The course is comprised of coursework subjects, practical experience through clinical placements and a research thesis in an area relevant to clinical neuropsychology.  All subjects are compulsory.  The academic members of the teaching staff are actively involved in the practice of clinical neuropsychology (including supervision of clinical trainees) in a teaching hospital, and are therefore well positioned to bring to the teaching situation a high level of clinical and research expertise.",
        "Students undertake clinical placements in a wide variety of services that cover acute care neurology and neurosurgery, psychiatry, geriatrics, rehabilitation, and paediatrics. The placement experience enjoyed by our students is one of the most extensive in the world."
