        "There will be no further entry into this course. The course structure below only applies to re-enrolling students who commenced their studies prior to 2015.",
        "From 2016, refer to the DR-PHILENG: Doctor of Philosophy - Engineering.",
        "The degree of Doctor of Philosophy signifies that the holder has undertaken a substantial piece of original research, which has been conducted and reported by the holder under proper academic supervision and in a research environment for a prescribed period.",
        "The PhD thesis demonstrates authority in the candidate's field and shows evidence of command of knowledge in relevant fields. It shows that the candidate has a thorough grasp of the appropriate methodological techniques and an awareness of their limitations. The thesis also makes a distinct contribution to knowledge. Its contribution to knowledge rests on originality of approach and / or interpretation of the findings and, in some cases, the discovery of new facts. The thesis demonstrates an ability to communicate research findings effectively in the professional arena and in an international context. It is a careful, rigorous and sustained piece of work demonstrating that a research 'apprenticeship' is complete and the holder is admitted to the community of scholars in the discipline.",
        "In scope, the PhD thesis differs from a research Masters thesis chiefly by its deeper and more comprehensive treatment of the chosen subject. It is written succinctly, in English, unless approval has been given for the thesis to be written in a language other than English. The normal length of a PhD thesis is 80,000 words, exclusive of words in tables, maps, bibliographies, and appendices. Footnotes are included as part of the word limit. The thesis should not exceed 100,000 words (or equivalent) without special approval from the Research Higher Degrees Committee.",
        "A candidate will have appropriately experienced supervisor(s) and an Advisory Committee who in consultation with the candidate, arranges a course of supervised research designed to suit the individual requirements and interests of the candidate. A candidate may be required to supplement their research program by attendance at, or enrolment in, additional subjects if considered necessary by the supervisor(s). All students are required to attend departmental seminars over the period of their candidature.",
        "Duration",
        "The normal period of candidature is three years for full-time candidates with the possibility of two, six month extensions. All PhD candidates are required to complete a minimum of 12 months full-time research at the University in order to benefit from planning, conducting and writing up their research within a University community and environment. Normally the entire PhD is undertaken at the University. To be eligible to submit a thesis students must be enrolled in their course for the minimum period of 24 months full-time equivalent.",
        "Intake",
        "Students may commence a PhD at any time during the year subject to prior arrangement with their nominated supervisor.",
        "Graduate research students in the School of Engineering are required to enrol in coursework components. Enrolment in these coursework subjects is dependent on commencement in the PhD-Engineering prior to the first day of scheduled classes. Students are encouraged to enrol into their graduate research degree prior to Semester 1 or Semester 2 class commencement if they are intending on enrolling in coursework subjects in the corresponding semester.",
        "Please check with the relevant department prior to making any arrangements for enrolment or travel."

            "All PhD candidates are required to complete the equivalent of at least 12 months full-time (24 months part-time) advanced study and research in the University unless studying at an outside institution approved by the Research Higher Degrees Committee (RHDC). The RHDC will not approve entirely distance supervision or entirely on-line supervision for research higher degree students.Throughout their candidature candidates are expected to attend the University in order to benefit from planning, conducting and writing up their research within a University community and environment.The residency requirement is deemed especially important during the period of probationary candidature. During probationary candidature the student is expected to interact on a regular basis with the supervisor, the department (including staff and other research students) and the University, so as: to build the skills and knowledge necessary to carry out the proposed research program to acquire an understanding of the standards and requirements for a PhD awarded by the University to make use of support programs and facilities provided by the Melbourne School of Graduate Research throughout candidature. It is University policy to take all reasonable steps to minimise the impact of disability upon academic study, and reasonable adjustments will be made to enhance a student's participation in the University's programs. Students who feel their disability will impact on meeting the requirements of this course are encouraged to discuss this matter with a Faculty Student Adviser and the Disability Liaison."
