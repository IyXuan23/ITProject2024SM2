        "The aim of the course is to build the knowledge and skills of educational practitioners so that they can develop, critique and utilise a range of data and draw on the latest educational research to devise interventions that improve student outcomes at the individual, group, team and school levels. The course will explore the nature of evidence and clinical teaching and the development and use of data, supporting candidates to acquire the skills to generate, interpret and evaluate various forms of student data. It will introduce candidates to key theories around how students learn and recent research on how to identify accurately student learning needs and provide instruction that is targeted to those needs. Course candidates will engage in a range of activities designed to draw upon and enable them to understand more fully their own particular experiences and roles in school and preschool education.",
