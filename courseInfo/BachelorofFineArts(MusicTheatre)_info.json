        "The Bachelor of Fine Arts (Music Theatre) is a three-year degree that equips graduates with the knowledge and artistic technical skills necessary to engage and thrive in the professional music theatre industry.",
        "The course offers immersive, integrated and experiential practice-based studio and performance studies in acting, voice, dance and music. Students will also have a choice of subjects that allow them to explore cross disciplinary studies, exposing them to multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills.",
        "Embedded in the cultural capital of Australia, students will learn from internationally recognised performers, teachers and industry professionals. Students will also have opportunities to work with visiting artists from Australia and abroad. As graduates, they will be equipped with the singing, dancing and acting skills to perform in a diverse range of contexts including professional music theatre, theatre, television, film and cabaret.",
        "In the first year, the students engage in foundational techniques to develop and strengthen their instrument (body and voice) enabling creative self-expression. In the second year, the students will use their instrument to engage in adjustments applied to style and character. Before entering the final year of study, students will have the unique opportunity to travel overseas or to involve themselves in a professional internship. The synthesis of these skills culminates in third year with multiple capstone experiences. These capstone experiences provide the opportunity to work with industry professionals to mount two full scale musicals and an industry showcase."
