        "The Doctor of Medicine (MD) program is a four-year postgraduate, entry to practice medical course. Graduates of the program are prepared to join the medical workforce as an intern, with the requisite knowledge, skills and attributes to deliver excellent healthcare within the Australian health system.",
        "The MD is a full-time course of study, with learning in clinical settings in each year of the program. Student\u2019s learning is structured around three domains: applied biomedical science, clinical skills and professional practice. Embedded within each of these domains are the themes of First Nations Health, Population and Global Health and research methods. In Year 1 students will develop foundational knowledge and skills via small group tutorials, practicals, clinical placement and interactive online learning.  In years 2 and 3 students are immersed in full time clinical placement where they apply foundational knowledge and skills to a broad range of patient encounters in a wide variety of health care settings. Clinical placement is complemented with small group tutorials, simulation, clinical and procedural skills alongside online interactive learning. In Year 4 students complete a research project in an area of interest and undertake a clinical placement-based capstone experience- learning as trainee junior doctors. This final capstone experience ensures that students are well prepared for their pending entry into the health care workforce.",
        "A highlight of the MD program is the opportunity for students to individualise their learning experiences through participation in a Discovery learning pathway at each level of the MD. Discovery learning can be selected from a variety of bespoke clinically focused topics or from a curated list of approved faculty subjects allowing students to explore a wide range of areas or complete a deeper dive into a future speciality. In the final two years of Discovery learning, students can choose to follow a research scholar pathway that extends their knowledge and skills in research and leadership or a clinical scholar pathway that extends their knowledge and skills in health advocacy and leadership.",
        "Another unique feature of the Melbourne MD is the yearly student conference. The MD Student Conference provides opportunities for broader disciplinary and inter-disciplinary learning and brings together all students from the MD. The conference allows students to participate in future focused learning and provides opportunities to explore areas of interest beyond core medical practice.",
        "Beyond core, discovery and conference learning, students also have the opportunity to complete an elective placement outside of their allocated clinical school to broaden their understanding of health care. Rural rotations are available to all students to provide opportunities to experience clinical training in a rural setting.",
        "Overall the Doctor of Medicine is an ungraded course, with subject achievement being a pass/fail. An ungraded MD is intended to decrease stress and improve student wellbeing, promote intrinsic motivation and longer-term learning, foster collaborative practice, and to support professional identify formation. Minimum performance standards across all standardised assessments in the MD program (for example OSCE and MCQ assessments) are set using widely accepted standard setting methods (such as the Modified Angoff and Borderline Regression approaches). Non-standardised assessments (such as workplace based assessments) and written assignments are assessed on a 5-point Likert scale, with the minimum performance standard (\u201csatisfactory\u201d) carefully mapped to the relevant subject and course intended learning outcomes.",

Except for (i) applicants eligible under the Guaranteed entry pathway, and (ii) as explicitly provided for under note 6 below, the Grade Point Average (GPA) used to rank applicants on academic merit based on their previous tertiary studies will be computed in the following way. The most recent bachelor degree results (including Honours*) will be used for the purposes of calculating the Grade Point Average (GPA) regardless of any subsequent graduate studies completed. The Grade Point Average (GPA) will be measured by considering the last three years of the applicant's undergraduate coursework studies (including Honours*). Weightings will be applied by weighting the first of the final three years by 1, the second year by 2 and the final year by 2. Please note that results for 2020 subjects completed before the COVID-19 pandemic will be included in GPA calculations. Results for honours completed in 2020 will be included in GPA calculations for 2022 and all future intakes. All other 2020 subject results will be excluded from GPA calculations for 2022 and all future intakes. If an applicant completed their final year of undergraduate study in 2020, weightings will be applied by weighting the first year of the final three years by 1, the second year by 2 and the final year subjects completed before the pandemic by 2. If an applicant completed their penultimate year of undergraduate study in 2020, weightings will be applied by weighting the first year of the final three years by 1, the second year subjects completed before the pandemic by 2 and the final year by 2. If an applicant completed their first year (of the final three years) of undergraduate study in 2020, weightings will be applied by weighting the first year subjects completed before the pandemic by 1, the second year by 2 and the final year by 2.

            "The cost and logistical impact of the adjustment.",
            "Students should note that a reasonable adjustment may include modification to assessment and providing additional support services, but the University cannot make an adjustment which would affect the academic integrity of the MD course or patient safety. Similarly, part of the MD course takes place at clinical sites off-campus where it may not be reasonable for the University to make the same adjustments that are possible on campus. This means that having a disability which prevents training in a particular context may have implications for completion of course requirements and future practice.",
            "Once enrolled in the MD course, students with a disability are encouraged to register with the Student Equity and Disability Service as early as possible. The role of this Service is to determine reasonable adjustments, following consultations with students and the School, and to provide information and advice to students in this context.",
