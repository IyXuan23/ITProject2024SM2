Composition applicants must include a compositional CV detailing a list of works published, commercial CDs released, major performances, broadcasts and festivals, critical reviews, awards, and competitive commissions. Scores and recordings are not required at the initial stage of application.

Applicants may be required to attend an interview and the committee may request further supporting materials.
