    "Overview text": [
        "The Master of International Journalism (MIJ) is targeted at students interested in understanding and producing journalism in an international field of practice, where it is important that key skills are complemented by an understanding of different professional traditions, conventions, cultures and challenges.  It particularly seeks to cater for aspiring journalists or mid-career professionals concerned to develop an international career, by providing an in-depth focus on different traditions, media systems and industry environments. The Masters of International Journalism combines an emphasis on key skills - newsgathering and newswriting, video, audio, digital and social media production \u2013 with an international outlook on how different media operate in different cultures and markets. It also focuses on particular areas where a transnational perspective and knowledge is important, such as business and finance journalism. The degree supports understanding of the different expectations, pressures and opportunities of journalism in different industry, regulatory and cultural environments, and how globalisation and digitisation are contributing to change within and across these settings. It prepares graduates to be confident and knowledgeable practitioners in a diverse and rapidly changing international field of practice, while equipping them with the skills to successfully operate in the fast-changing environment of digital journalism. The degree also offers the potential for substantial coursework elements, including Internships, Journalism Project and Journalism Thesis, to be completed in international settings."
