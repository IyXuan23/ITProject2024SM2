        "Biotechnology is the useful application of a biological product or process. The process of commercialisation is inevitably required for a discovery to become applied and widely used.",
        "Biotechnology is a growing area of applied science and covers a diversity of specialist fields. Disciplines that Biotechnology includes are; molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, plant and environmental sciences, engineering, drug development, nanofabrication, reproductive sciences, stem cells and genetically modified organisms. Modern medicine, agriculture, animal breeding, pharmaceuticals, food production and processing etc., all utilise various Biotechnology tools.",
        "The core disciplines will focus on advances in key technologies, and will give the student the scientific understanding of how discoveries progress from the laboratory to the marketplace. This scientific knowledge will be developed together with an understanding of what is procedurally required to transform a discovery into a useful and commercialised product or process. This includes such areas as Intellectual Property, Market Structure, Drug Trial Design, Regulatory Affairs, Quality Management and Good Manufacturing Processes.",
        "This professional entry program offers students the opportunity to undertake core science studies as well as professional skills modules, which provide high-level training in the areas of business, communications and science application.",
        "In the second year of study students will work in groups to undertake an Industry Project with a company external to the University.",
        "Outstanding students may replace the Industry Project with the Research Project, depending upon the availability of a suitable project and supervisor. Upon successful completion of the Research Project, students may be eligible to apply to study for a PhD at the University of Melbourne."

            "The Master of Biotechnology welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is University and degree policy to take all reasonable steps to minimise the impact of disability upon academic study, and reasonable adjustments will be made to enhance a student\u2019s participation in the degree. The Master of Biotechnology requires all students to enrol in subjects where they will require:(1) the ability to comprehend complex science and technology related information;(2) the ability to clearly and independently communicate a knowledge and application of science, and technology principles and practices during assessment tasks;(3) the ability to actively and safely contribute in clinical, laboratory, and fieldwork/excursion activities.",
            "Students must possess behavioural and social attributes that enable them to participate in a complex learning environment. Students are required to take responsibility for their own participation and learning. They also contribute to the learning of other students in collaborative learning environments, demonstrating interpersonal skills and an understanding of the needs of other students. Assessment may include the outcomes of tasks completed in collaboration with other students. There may be additional inherent academic requirements for some subjects, and these requirements are listed within the description of the requirements for each of these subjects. Students who feel their disability will impact on meeting this requirement are encouraged to discuss this matter with the relevant Subject Coordinator and the Disability Liaison Unit:http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/"
