        "Disaster events are taking place with increasing frequency across the globe.

Neighbouring countries in our region have dealt with earthquakes, cyclones, and disease outbreaks, including the devastating measles epidemic in the Pacific Islands. Globally, we are seeing a rise in conflict and the convergence of natural disasters with conflict, leading to mass population displacement in vulnerable communities.",
