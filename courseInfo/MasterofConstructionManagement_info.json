        "Construction Management is a discipline that incorporates any area of technical endeavour seeking to improve our ability to manage industrial structures, fabrication and procurement processes, and the output of buildings. In line with the mission of the Melbourne School of Design, graduate studies within Construction Management integrates the present requirements of professional training and education with the future needs of the industry, domestically as well as internationally. To this end, the Master of Construction Management at the University of Melbourne rests as much on practice as it does on theory: it is a professional degree for graduates who not only want to gain employment in the construction industry, but also want to contribute to tackling its social, technological, financial and environmental challenges.",
        "The Master of Construction Management provides students with the possibility to organise their studies and concentrate their curricula in three different areas of specialisation:",
        "These areas provide graduates with the foundation for a future career in construction or academia. They are also designed for those returning to study from the industry, who are interested in further developing their expertise by accessing knowledge frameworks not yet broadly available in practice. Each area has its own list of core and selective subjects.",
        "Depending on their specialisation, graduates are prepared to work with general construction companies, quantity surveying organisations, project management firms, trade specialists, specialised consultants, institutional bodies, government, and research institutions.",
        "Course duration may not be reduced as a result of receiving advanced standing. For further details contact the Faculty."

            "The Melbourne School of Design is the graduate school of the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning. It offers professional entry programs in Architecture, Construction Management, Landscape Architecture, Property and Urban Planning. It offers specialist development programs in Property Valuation, Planning and Design and in Urban Design.The Melbourne School of Design welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is the University and Faculty (Architecture, Building and Planning) policy to take reasonable steps to make reasonable adjustments so as to enable students\u2019 participation in degrees offered by the Melbourne School of Design (MSD).A candidate for degrees offered in the MSD must have abilities and skills which include the following: observation; communication; motor; conceptual, integrative, and quantitative; and behavioural and social. Adjustments can be provided to minimise the impact of a disability, however, particularly at Masters level, students need to be able to participate in programs in an independent manner and with regard to their safety and the safety of others.(i)Observation: Candidates must be able to read text, diagrams, maps, drawings and numerical data. Candidates should be able to observe details at a number of scales and to record useful observations of environmental contexts.(ii)Communication: Candidates should be able to communicate with fellow students, professional and academic staff, members of relevant professions and the public. Candidates must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing.(iii)Motor: Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from environmental contexts. Off campus investigations may include visits to construction sites, urban, rural and/or remote environments. Candidates should have sufficient motor ability to prepare documentation of analytic texts, drawings and models of findings and for the preparation of proposals for environmental interventions via digital or other means. Candidates should have the ability to actively participate in appropriate site and/or design studio-based activities.(iv)Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, synthesis and, importantly, the ability to interpret results of such work. Problem resolution, the critical skill demanded of graduates, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, given the disciplines pursued in the MSD, candidates should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships in environmental structures of a wide range of scales \u2013 from smaller than the individual through individual buildings and urban spaces to large geographic areas. Further, graduate study entails learning to master one\u2019s own abilities and skills and to deploy them strategically. This requires further developing skills in both reflective and reflexive thinking and being able to practice these skills.(v)Behavioural and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess behavioural and social attributes that enable them to participate in a complex learning environment. Students are required to take responsibility for their own participation and learning. They also contribute to the learning of other students in collaborative learning environments, demonstrating interpersonal skills and an understanding of the needs of other students. Assessment may include the outcomes of tasks completed in collaboration with other students.Students who feel a disability will prevent them from meeting the above academic requirements are encouraged to contact the Disability Liaison Unit."
