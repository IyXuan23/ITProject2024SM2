        "The Master of Public Policy and Management is one of the oldest graduate programs in this field in Australia, with the University of Melbourne first bridging the needs of the profession and the emerging discipline almost 90 years ago. It has remained at the forefront of the discipline through consistent innovation in subject delivery and content and is notably one of the few graduate degrees in the country to combine expert training in public policy analysis and executive leadership and management. The course is structured around working professionals (both current and aspiring) and therefore emphasises flexibility and tailored options. While the focus is on the public sector, the private and community sectors are also examined in order to prepare graduates for the widest possible range of careers both in Australia and internationally. This international dimension is further emphasised by the diversity of researchers and practitioners teaching into the program and the unique subject offerings."
