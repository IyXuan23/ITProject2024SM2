        "The Graduate Certificate in Education (Learning Difficulties) will develop understandings of learning difficulties and interactions between different types of learning difficulties, including dyslexia and dyscalculia. The course will enhance participants\u2019 skills in classroom assessment, including the administration of screening tools, probes, checklists, and informal measures, alongside commonly used standardised tests, in order to augment goal setting, instructional choices and responsiveness to learning difficulties. Data-based decision-making, ongoing progress monitoring, and the provision of increasing levels of support for learners in classrooms, schools and systems will be framed using multi-tiered prevention logic. Inclusive pedagogies such as Universal Design for Learning, differentiation, and matching adaptations to learner need will be explored. The course provides a foundation for the Master of Learning Intervention."
