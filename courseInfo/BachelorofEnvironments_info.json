        "The Bachelor of Environments is an innovative initiative from the University of Melbourne. It provides students with the skills needed to be creative thinkers and to solve twenty-first century problems. The degree brings together expertise from a range of discipline areas across the University to provide leadership in the study of the built, natural, social and virtual environments, and is unique within Australia. This three year degree will give students a broad understanding across diverse environments, whilst providing them with the opportunity to focus on an area of specialisation of their choosing.",
        "The foundation of the degree is the inter-disciplinary nature of real-world projects, where professionals work together to bring projects to fruition. Only through innovative and integrated thinking that is an integral part of the Bachelor of Environments, will current challenges like sustainable urban growth and protection of threatened natural resources become attainable. Graduates of the Bachelor of Environments will be able to think about the environment beyond the short term, and play an active role in maintaining, imagining, designing and constructing sustainable areas in which to live, work and visit."
