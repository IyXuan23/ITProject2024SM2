        "The Master of Mechanical Engineering is an entry-to-practice degree that provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills to enter the international workplace as mechanical engineers.",
        "Graduates are skilled in the integration of engineering principles primarily spanning mechanical, electrical and software engineering; and have the ability to apply these skills to complex, open-ended engineering tasks and problems.  The degree builds upon a solid foundation in mathematics and physics.  Within the degree, students acquire core skills in the areas of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, rigid body mechanics, solid mechanics, systems dynamics and control, materials, engineering design and integration, safety, sustainability, management, communication and teamwork.  Students may also choose to undertake specialisations in areas including aerospace engineering, manufacturing engineering, materials engineering and engineering business management.  The degree culminates in a capstone design experience. Students have the opportunity to participate in overseas study, industry-based projects and supervised research.",
        "Distinction",
        "Upon completion of the Master of Mechanical Engineering, it is possible for a student to be awarded Master of Mechanical Engineering with Distinction provided a student has achieved a high level of academic performance. Eligibility of the Distinction award is dependent on a calculated distinction score.",
        "The distinction score will only take into account Level 9 subjects undertaken at the University of Melbourne. This means Study Abroad and Exchange subjects will not be considered. One 12.5 point subject with the lowest mark will be omitted in the calculation of the distinction score. All level 9 subjects with credit points of more than 12.5 points must be included in the calculations. Only marks from the first attempt at a subject will be used. The average mark will be weighted by the credit points of the subjects. A Master of Engineering with Distinction will be awarded if the score is 80 or above.",
