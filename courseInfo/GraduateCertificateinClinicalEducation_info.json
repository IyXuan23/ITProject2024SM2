    "Overview text": [
        "The Graduate Certificate in Clinical Education has evolved from the university's successful Graduate Certificate in University Teaching (GCUT). It uses much of the same proven pedagogy while locating learning within the clinical context to ensure that it resonates with busy clinicians. In recognition of workforce demands, participants will be able to choose between monthly contact days based at the Parkville campus four times per semester, or an intensive program with four days in the one week.",
        "The Graduate Certificate in Clinical Education has four practically-orientated subjects and will be delivered in association with the Centre for the Study of Higher Education, blending learners with the CSHE's GCUT stream when appropriate. The Graduate Certificate in Clinical Education will be unique in the international marketplace for its quality, flexibility and immediate utility.",
        "Clinicians who gain the University of Melbourne Graduate Certificate in Clinical Education will be valued for their commitment to clinical teaching. Those who progress to the Graduate Diploma in Clinical Education will be recognised for their advanced knowledge and skills, and those who undertake the Masters program for their demonstrated excellence in clinical education."
