        "Students will learn about the principles of rehabilitation and habilitation, the physiology of fitness and conditioning. The use of evidence informed clinical decision-making, emerging technologies and rehabilitation approaches, and strategies for the effective and safe implementation of rehabilitation in a range of practice contexts will be examined. Specifically, students will learn techniques including exercise prescription, goal setting and health behaviour modification. At a group level, students will learn to complete a health needs analysis for rehabilitation programs.",
