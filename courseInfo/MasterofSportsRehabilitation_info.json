The Masters in Sports Rehabilitation core subjects explore professional and clinical practice relating to sport and rehabilitation across the lifespan and across variable levels of abilities. Alongside 8 core (including a capstone) subject, the course includes 3 elective subjects enabling students to scaffold their learning according to their interest areas and practice context. These subjects all require analysis, synthesis and creative problem solving within a range of practice contexts; extending knowledge and understanding, research principles and new innovations that are necessary to undertake sports rehabilitation practice in different environments.",
