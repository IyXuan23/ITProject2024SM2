        "Government operates within a framework of law and practice, consistently with the rule of law. This framework includes constitutional law and administrative law but extends well beyond both to a host of particular legal regimes that apply to government actors.",
        "This is a dynamic branch of law, constantly changing in response to new pressures and government responses. It lends itself to comparison between countries, enabling students to understand different ways of tackling problems and to draw lessons from them. In an age of globalisation, it has a large and growing interface with international law, requiring a grasp of both areas.",
        "The specialisation in government law reflects the changing nature and complexity of the field. The subjects offer students expertise in matters that lie at the cutting-edge of government law in Australia and elsewhere."
