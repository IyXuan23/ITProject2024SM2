It is recommended that students consider undertaking screening and vaccination for Q Fever prior to commencement of study. Students may be required to provide proof of vaccination prior to undertaking some coursework. Vaccine costs for students are not covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), Medicare, or by the University.
