    "Overview text": [
        "The Master of Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne is a vibrant interdisciplinary program designed to accommodate a wide range of interests and to provide a broad understanding of the people, environment, cultures, society, politics, and economy of contemporary China. A flexible and varied course of instruction affords students interested in a professional career of engagement with China an opportunity to pursue their passions in business, media, government service, or non-governmental organisations (NGO). With expert tuition from China specialists, it also serves as an academic bridge for students who wish to enter a PhD program but require further background training or have yet to choose a discipline for doctoral studies.",
        "In this program you may put your China knowledge into practice through optional internships in international organisations, government, business, media and NGOs, or pursue a research thesis option to better prepare you for doctoral studies. Regardless of how you structure your Master\u2019s journey, you\u2019ll graduate able to make sense of contemporary China on its own terms and to understand better its changing role in the region and the world. Offering a world-class education, we expect our graduates will enjoy distinguished careers in public service, the private sector, academia, and other fields of meaningful endeavour."
