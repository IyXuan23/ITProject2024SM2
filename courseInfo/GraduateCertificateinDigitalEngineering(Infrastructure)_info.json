        "The course is a post-graduate degree (Level 8 of the Australian Qualifications Framework) equipping professionals in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), facilities management (FM), and similar industries with solid foundations in creating, capturing and integrating data in a digitised work environment, and supporting them to contribute to the transformation of the industry.",
        "Participants will advance their knowledge of digital engineering, including Building Information Modelling (BIM), sensor systems and Internet of Things (IoT), reality capture and information visualisation. They will use digital methods during asset creation, management, and operations, capturing facilities by multisource imaging techniques, building information modelling, and information visualisation. They will critically analyse and evaluate digital engineering alternatives for addressing complex problems in architecture, engineering, construction, and infrastructure and facilities management, and generate digital engineering solutions to improve and transform industry practices.",
        "The course may be taken entirely online, however several subjects are also delivered on campus (in a dual delivery mode).",
        "Please Note:This course is not listed on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) and therefore is not available to international students who require a student visa to study in Australia.
