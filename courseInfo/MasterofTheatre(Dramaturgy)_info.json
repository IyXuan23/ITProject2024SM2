    "Course name": "Master of Theatre (Dramaturgy)",
    "Course code": "MC-THTRDRA",
    "Overview text": [
        "This is the first and only course leading to a qualification in dramaturgy in Australia and Asia, and offers a unique curriculum emerging from its positioning within the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) and the artistic and cultural life of Melbourne. It is an 18-month, 150-point, Masters course that is closely interwoven with the Master of Theatre (Writing), and the Master of Theatre (Directing).",
        "During the program you will encounter and explore dramaturgy beyond work with written texts and literary play scripts to encompass the contexts of dance, hybrid works, installation, community-based and performance art work. The program provides opportunities for you to develop your potential for artistic leadership and attain in-depth knowledge of dramaturgical thinking and practices.",
        "The course is underpinned by a commitment to the pursuit of artistic excellence, collaboration and interdisciplinarity within established and emerging local, national and international dramaturgical practices.",
        "Students collaborate with other VCA graduate disciplines and engage with writers, directors, designers, choreographers, performance-makers and actors on a range of projects in an intensive training environment.",
        "The course provides a balance of theory and practice across three semesters through laboratory-based workshops, seminars, lectures, self-directed exercises, tutorials, practical master classes, practical work on performance projects and an independent project.",
        "The teaching-intense first semester focuses on building and refining practical skills and research training, including a discrete subject that engages closely with the dramaturgical expertise of Melbourne\u2019s diverse theatre industry. The teaching methodology is underpinned by the principle of bringing industry professionals onto the campus to interface with the students. The second semester allows for more hands-on practical experience though: a collaborative devising subject with directors, actors and designers; by working on new writing with the writing students; and by working as dramaturgs in internal/VCA projects directed by guests, staff or the second-year directors. Training is enhanced by a subject on Performance and Community Engagement.",
        "The third semester allows more independent practice and research, building reflective performance practitioners with a high level of research and practice skills commensurate with a Masters degree. It also focuses on preparation for industry alongside the second-year directors, developing students\u2019 industry practice and know-how in the context of the contemporary Australian and international performance environment. The course aim is that graduates will not just fit into an existing system but can be change-makers and leaders in this ecology.",
