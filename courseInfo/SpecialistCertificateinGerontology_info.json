        "This course examines the complex and growing challenges of an ageing worldwide population. The Specialist Certificate provides specialised knowledge and skills to understand ageing as a social, physical and psychological experience within the context of national policies and models of health and community care. The disciplines of population health, nursing, physiotherapy, social work, psychology, architecture and design, computing and information systems, and economics contribute to the subjects within the course.",
        "Students have the opportunity to select interest areas from a range of subjects focused on ageing and its implications, in diverse settings and contexts, including health care, workforce, housing, economic and social policy and technological advances supporting healthy ageing and aged care. The course provides a specialised focus on gerontology for clinicians, health care managers, social and community care providers and policy makers. The two-subject Specialist Certificate articulates with the four-subject Graduate Certificate in Gerontology but may also be taken as a stand-alone qualification for those seeking professional development in gerontology in specific disciplinary areas.",
