        "The Master of Art Curatorship introduces students to key concepts in art curatorship and equips them for a career in the art museum and gallery world. Students will gain a deep understanding of the changing contexts in which the art curatorial profession operates, such as globalisation and decolonisation, new curatorial innovations, shifts in art and art museums, and the impact of new technologies on art museums, art galleries and professional practice. The program delivers subjects in the key areas of museum theory and practice, art collection management and conservation, and the interpretation and curating of exhibitions, together with challenging analytical content that assists graduates to participate in the ethical, political and philosophical dimensions of curating art in an international context. Students have the opportunity to do an industry internship as part of their studies. Students also have the option to undertake a research thesis that can provide a pathway to PhD study."
