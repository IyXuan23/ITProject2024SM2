        "The Specialist Certificate in Cross-Cultural Conservation and Heritage is designed as a knowledge exchange program and draws on the Centre for Cultural Material Conservation\u2019s extensive industry and community partnerships to combine traditional and contemporary approaches to the preservation of cultural objects across a range of cultural settings. The Specialist Certificate focuses on the conservation of cultural material as a foundation for broader understandings of the significance of culture as a source of identity, social cohesion and sustainable development. The Program provides students from diverse cultural and professional backgrounds with the opportunity to benefit from the expertise held by fellow students and their communities, and from Indigenous experts in Australia and other cultural leaders in the Asia-Pacific region. The Specialist Certificate is designed for practicing museum and heritage workers to gain access to and expertise in contemporary and traditional approaches to conservation, for Indigenous students seeking entry to graduate study and for a range of professionals seeking to work with Indigenous communities. The Specialist Certificate is a pathway to further study in the Graduate Certificate in Arts (Advanced) - Cultural Material Conservation and Master of Cultural Materials Conservation.",
