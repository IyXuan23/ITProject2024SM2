        "The Master of Science (Epidemiology) is a coursework masters degree incorporating a supervised research project.",
        "Epidemiology is the scientific method used to track population health, to find cause of disease (and health) and to identify ways to prevent disease. It is often called the basic science of public health, but its principles extend to clinical research and practice. Epidemiologists are the medical detectives for populations. They solve puzzles about who gets diseases, what causes disease and how to prevent disease.",
        "The Master of Science (Epidemiology) gives students the opportunity to undertake a supervised research project in a field of choice as well as a broad range of coursework subjects including a professional skills component, as a pathway to PhD study or to the workforce"
