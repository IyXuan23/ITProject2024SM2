        "Students will be introduced to many of the issues underpinning the advances in food and fibre production within the Australian and International Agriculture sectors. The available subjects within the Graduate Certificate in Agricultural Sciences cover a range of plant and animal disciplines as well as a focus on current and emerging environmental agricultural and associated industry impacts.",
        "Students undertake interdisciplinary studies in the nature of agricultural crop, food and fibre production and markets at an advanced level. Knowledge and skills are developed in environmental, economic, social and ethical factors related to plant- and animal-derived food and fibre production in Australia and globally. Graduates will have a foundation in the scientific principles and analytical skills behind improved agricultural production systems and their sustainability.",

            "The Faculty of Science welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is University and Faculty policy to take reasonable steps to make reasonable adjustments so as to enable the student\u2019s participation in the Faculty's programs. The Faculty of Science contributes to the New Generation degrees and offers a broad range of programs across undergraduate and post-graduate levels many of which adopt a multi-disciplinary approach.",
            "Students of the Faculty's courses must possess intellectual, ethical, and emotional capabilities required to participate in the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the Faculty. Students must have abilities and skills in observation; motor in relevant areas; communication; in conceptual, integrative, and quantitative dimensions; and in behavioural and social dimensions.",
            "Adjustments can be provided to minimise the impact of a disability, however students need to be able to participate in the program in an independent manner and with regard to their safety and the safety of others.",
            "I. Observation:In some contexts, the student must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic and applied sciences. More broadly, observation requires reading text, diagrams, maps, drawings and numerical data. Students should be able to observe details at a number of scales and record useful observations in discipline dependant contexts.",
            "II. Communication:Students must be able to communicate with fellow students, professional and academic staff, members of relevant professions and the public.   Students should be able to communicate effectively and sensitively. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing.",
            "III. Motor:Students should have sufficient motor function necessary for participation in the inherent discipline-related activities. The practical work, design work, field work, diagnostic procedures, laboratory tests, require varying motor movement abilities. Off campus investigations may include visits to construction sites, urban, rural and/or remote environments.",
            "IV. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities:These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of professionals in land and environment industries, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the student should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures.",
            "V. Behavioural and Social Attributes:Students must possess behavioural and social attributes that enable them to participate in a complex learning environment. Students are required to take responsibility for their own participation and learning. They also contribute to the learning of other students in collaborative learning environments, demonstrating interpersonal skills and an understanding of the needs of other students. Assessment may include the outcomes of tasks completed in collaboration with other students.",
