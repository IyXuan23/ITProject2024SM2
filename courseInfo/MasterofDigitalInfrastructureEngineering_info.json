        "The professional Master of Digital Infrastructure Engineering is a degree that provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills to enter the international workplace where engineering and information technology meet: Graduates are skilled in connecting the physical world with digital world principles, and in applying these skills to complex, open-ended engineering tasks and problems.",
        "Within the course, students will learn how to capture built and natural environments in digital representations and how to accurately position in these environments using satellites, robots, laser scanning, or radio-based methods. They will study how to sense these environments and integrate semantic data into consistent multi-scale models. They will apply statistical and machine learning for data analysis for pattern recognition, prediction, and simulation-based engineering. They will also gain knowledge on how to visualise and communicate spatial and temporal information, and to conceptualise and use the digital models of the physical world in an ethical manner. They apply this knowledge for interaction between this information and the physical world in digital twins, resource-aware management, resilient communities, and simulation-based engineering, supporting a more sustainable and liveable future. Students may choose to specialize in one of these application areas, including land, construction, cities, mobility, energy, water, data, information technology, information systems, business, and more.",
        "The Master of Digital Infrastructure Engineering (Land) is fully accredited by the Surveyors Registration Board Victoria.",
        "Distinction",
        "Upon completion of the Master of Digital Infrastructure Engineering, it is possible for a student to be awarded Master of Digital Infrastructure Engineering with Distinction provided a student has achieved a high level of academic performance. Eligibility of the Distinction award is dependent on a calculated distinction score.",
        "The distinction score will only take into account Level 9 subjects undertaken at the University of Melbourne. This means Study Abroad and Exchange subjects will not be considered. One 12.5 point subject with the lowest mark will be omitted in the calculation of the distinction score. All level 9 subjects with credit points of more than 12.5 points must be included in the calculations.",
        "Only marks from the first attempt at a subject will be used. The average mark will be weighted by the credit points of the subjects. A Master of Engineering with Distinction will be awarded if the score is 80 or above.",
        "Hurdle Requirement",
        "In order to achieve the Engineering Practice Hurdle requirement, students will need to document the attainment of professional skills at an adequate level. This may include the successful completion of any of the following:",
