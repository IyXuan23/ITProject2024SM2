        "The Doctor of Physiotherapy (DPT) is a 3-year, full-time (300 credit point) entry to practice graduate degree.",
        "The curriculum is designed around three identities: Self, Practitioner and Advocate. These three key identities are supported by nine elements: Professional Practitioner, Health and Wellbeing, Evidence Informed Practice, Partnerships, Education, Communication, Ethical Practice, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Engagement and Sustainability. Identities and elements provide both horizontal and vertical integration throughout the program. Further, each subject description provides learning outcomes aligned to the identities and elements.",
        "The \u2018constructive alignment\u2019 model has been used in designing each subject within the program. This model aligns each learning outcome with both teaching activities and assessment tasks. Assessment tasks emphasize a mix of individual and group work assessment, written and oral presentations in traditional and in e-assessment formats, and skills-based assessment. In addition, students will build an e-portfolio to demonstrate their professional journey, acquisition of professional skills and identity.",
        "The program will be delivered outside the standard university semester. The semesters are 14 weeks in duration. This allows us to incorporate the clinical component of the course within the subjects.",

        "Entry requirements": [
            "1. In order to be considered for entry, applicants must have completed:\u2022 Either\u2013 An undergraduate degree in any discipline, with studies to have been completed within 10 years of commencing the Doctor of Physiotherapy, or\u2013 For applicants whose most recently completed undergraduate degree was completed 10 or more years before 1 January of the year in which the applicant intends to commence the Doctor of Physiotherapy, a Graduate Diploma, Master or PhD degree or equivalent completed within 10 years before 1 January of the year in which the applicant intends to commence the Doctor of Physiotherapy;  and\u2022 Pre-requisite University subjects in human anatomy and in human physiology or equivalent (one subject of each), with pre-requisite subjects to have been completed within 10 years of commencing the Doctor of Physiotherapy; and\u2022 A multi-mini interview (which may be restricted to shortlisted applicants).Meeting these requirements does not guarantee selection.2. In ranking applications, the Selection Committee will consider:\u2022 Prior academic performance; and \u2022 The interview.3. The Selection Committee may seek further information to clarify any aspect of an application in accordance with the Academic Board rules on the use of selection instruments.4. Applicants are required to satisfy the university\u2019s English language requirements for postgraduate courses. For those applicants seeking to meet these requirements by one of the standard tests approved by the Academic Board, performance band 7 is required.Additional notes for the Handbook1. The performance of applicants in their previous studies will be assessed using a Grade Point Average (GPA) computed in a manner approved by the Academic Board for the Doctor of Physiotherapy (see note 2 below). The GPA will be used to determine which applicants are shortlisted for multi-mini interview. Offers will be made on the basis of a combined ranked list where ranks by GPA and interview are given equal weighting.2. Except for (i) applicants eligible under the Guaranteed Pathway and (ii) as explicitly provided for under clause 5 below, the Grade Point Average (GPA) used to rank applicants on academic merit based on their tertiary previous studies will be computed in the following way. The most recent bachelor degree results (including Honours) will be used for the purposes of calculating the Grade Point Average (GPA) regardless of any subsequent graduate studies completed. The Grade Point Average (GPA) will be measured by considering the last three years of the applicant's undergraduate coursework studies (including Honours). Weightings will be applied by weighting the first of the final three years by 1, the second year by 2 and the final year by 2.\nPlease note that results for 2020 subjects completed before the COVID-19 pandemic will be included in GPA calculations. Results for honours completed in 2020 will be included in GPA calculations for 2022 and all future intakes. All other 2020 subject results will be excluded from GPA calculations for 2022 and all future intakes.\nIf an applicant completed their final year of undergraduate study in 2020, weightings will be applied by weighting the first year of the final three years by 1, the second year by 2 and the final year subjects completed before the pandemic by 2.\nIf an applicant completed their penultimate year of undergraduate study in 2020, weightings will be applied by weighting the first year of the final three years by 1, the second year subjects completed before the pandemic by 2 and the final year by 2.\nIf an applicant completed their first year (of the final three years) of undergraduate study in 2020, weightings will be applied by weighting the first year subjects completed before the pandemic by 1, the second year by 2 and the final year by 2.For the avoidance of doubt, please note that subjects from all other study periods will be calculated according to the standard GPA calculation method described at the beginning of point 2.\r\n3. In considering students under special entry schemes the Selection Committee will consider aspects of disadvantage as set out from time to time in the University of Melbourne Graduate Access policy, evidence of rurality for rural applicants, and confirmation of aboriginality for indigenous applicants.4. Students applying for the Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Physiotherapy, or Doctor of Dental Surgery from the University of Melbourne degrees of Bachelor of Agriculture, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Biomedicine, Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Environments, Bachelor of Design, Bachelor of Oral Health, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science who meet entry and course requirements for a guaranteed place are admitted subject only to meeting any minimum grade point average as prescribed by the Academic Board; satisfactory performance at an interview to demonstrate adequate communication skills (Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Physiotherapy only); and completion of relevant pre-requisite subjects on the first attempt. Please note that results for 2020 subjects completed before the COVID-19 pandemic will be included in entry score calculations. Results for honours completed in 2020 will be included in calculations for 2022 and all future intakes. All other 2020 subject results will be excluded from calculations for 2022 and all future intakes. For the avoidance of doubt, subjects from all other study periods will be included in entry score calculations.5. The Selection Committee may re-rank applicants with a high level of performance in postgraduate studies in a cognate area subject to the following:\u2022 postgraduate study must have been completed within ten years of commencement of theDoctor of Medicine, Doctor of Dental Surgery or Doctor of Physiotherapy;\u2022 postgraduate study must be the equivalent of at least a one year full time program;\u2022 postgraduate study must be in a discipline that builds upon studies completed at the undergraduate level;\u2022 postgraduate study must be in a health related or biological sciences discipline.The quotas of places available for selection of applicants re-ranked on the basis of postgraduate study as prescribed below are set initially as follows:(a) Doctor of Medicine \u2014 up to 10 places,(b) Doctor of Dental Surgery \u2014 up to 2 places, (c) Doctor of Physiotherapy \u2014 up to 3 places.Re-ranked applicants not selected on this basis, who otherwise satisfy the selection criteria, will be considered on the basis of their undergraduate results.

Physiotherapy practice in Australia is bound by the Registration Standards defined by the Physiotherapy Registration Board.

It is not reasonable for students to use an intermediary as an adjustment to compensate for a disability impacting on any of the five categories listed below. In the clinical environment there is a primary duty of care to the patients, and the needs of students cannot compromise this.
