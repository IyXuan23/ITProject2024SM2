            "For the purposes of considering request for Reasonable Adjustments under the Disability Standards for Education (Cwth 2005), and Students Experiencing Academic Disadvantage Policy, academic requirements for the DOCTOR OF CLINICAL DENTISTRY are articulated in the Course Description, Course Objectives, Generic Skills and Assessment Requirements of this entry.",
            "The University is dedicated to provide support to those with special requirements. Further details on the disability support scheme can be found at the Student Equity and Disability Support website:",
            "http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/",
            "The Melbourne Dental School policy outlining requirements in relation to student disability for entry to and progression within the DOCTOR OF CLINICAL DENTISTRY are outlined below.",
            "Melbourne Dental School Policy in Relation to Students with Disabilities",
            "The curriculum of the DOCTOR OF CLINICAL DENTISTRY has been developed using graduate attribute statements in six domains (professionalism, scientific knowledge, patient care, dental profession, systems of health care and the society). Students entering the Melbourne DOCTOR OF CLINICAL DENTISTRY must therefore have the aptitude to achieve these attributes during the course.",
            "Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, insight into the effects of their own behaviour, and motivation are all personal qualities that will be assessed during the admissions and education processes.",
            "The Melbourne Dental School welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is University and Faculty policy to take all reasonable steps to minimise the impact of disability upon academic study. Appropriate adjustments will be made to enhance the participation of students with a disability in the dental course. A prospective student with a disability is advised to discuss with the staff in the student service centres issues related to his or her ability to successfully meet all the course requirements.",
            "All students of the DOCTOR OF CLINICAL DENTISTRY must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical and emotional capabilities required to participate in the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence at graduation required by the faculty and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation agency.",
            "A student with a disability may be asked to provide independent medical or other clinical assessments of the disability and its possible impact on the ability of the student to successfully complete the course, before being accepted into the course. This statement would be treated in confidence with only those on the admissions committee and the Student Equity and Disability Support having access to the document.",
            "Deliberate misinformation about the student\u2019s ability to successfully complete the course will be regarded as unprofessional practice and treated as such.",
            "While the Melbourne Dental School will make reasonable adjustments to minimise the impact of a disability, all students must be able to participate in the program in an independent manner. It is not reasonable for students to use an intermediary as an adjustment to compensate for a disability impacting on any of the five categories. In the clinical environment there is a primary duty of care to the patients and the needs of students cannot compromise this. It is expected that all students will be able to participate fully in all classroom based learning activities and to successfully fulfil the self-study requirements of the course. The presence of a disability will not automatically entitle the student to preferential treatment in clinical place allocation.",
