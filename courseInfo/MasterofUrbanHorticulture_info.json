        "The Master of Urban Horticulture (Coursework) was developed specifically for those seeking professional employment or developing research careers in urban horticulture and landscape management. There is a focus on the design, implementation and management of urban landscapes. Employment opportunities can be found in a variety of settings including arboricultural services and tree management, urban parks and public open space, revegetation and restoration, residential landscape design, landscape and asset management, landscape construction and services and in nursery and greenhouse management. Upon completion of the course students can progress to PhD studies at the University of Melbourne. Whilst it is beneficial for students to have some experience in the horticultural industry it is not essential to have previous employment to gain entry to the course. There are different pathways for students depending on the previous studies completed. The course has excellent linkages and contacts to the urban horticulture industry, adding to the currency and relevancy of the study experience, but also building employment opportunities for the future.",
