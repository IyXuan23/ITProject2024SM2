        "The Graduate Program in Engineering Structures is designed to meet the needs of graduates involved in disciplines associated with the advanced design of engineering structures. The Program includes contemporary issues such as ecologically sustainable buildings and the design of structures for extreme loading, such as earthquake, wind, blast and fire. Participants are also able to choose from a wide range of elective subjects including subjects focusing on project management and architecture. The major themes of this course are: structural systems, conceptual design, sustainable design, extreme loading and advanced analysis techniques.",
