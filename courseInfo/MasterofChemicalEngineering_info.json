    "Overview text": [
        "The Master of Chemical Engineering is an entry-to-practice degree that provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills to enter the international workplace as chemical engineers. Graduates are skilled in chemical engineering principles and have the ability to apply these skills to complex, open-ended engineering tasks and problems. The degree provides sequential study in the chemical engineering discipline, building on a solid foundation in mathematics and chemistry. Within the degree, students acquire core skills in the areas of momentum, mass and heat transfer, reactor design and use of catalysts, separation processes, thermodynamics, process control and simulation, chemical engineering design, safety, sustainability, management, communication and teamwork. Students may also choose to undertake specialisations in areas including chemical engineering management, sustainability and environment, and materials and minerals engineering. The degree culminates in a capstone design experience. Students have the opportunity to participate in overseas study, industry-based internships and supervised research placements.",
        "Distinction",
        "Upon completion of the Master of Chemical Engineering, it is possible for a student to be awarded Master of Chemical Engineering with Distinction provided a student has achieved a high level of academic performance. Eligibility of the Distinction award is dependent on a calculated distinction score.",
        "The distinction score will only take into account Level 9 subjects undertaken at the University of Melbourne. This means Study Abroad and Exchange subjects will not be considered. One 12.5 point subject with the lowest mark will be omitted in the calculation of the distinction score. All level 9 subjects with credit points of more than 12.5 points must be included in the calculations. Only marks from the first attempt at a subject will be used. The average mark will be weighted by the credit points of the subjects. A Master of Engineering with Distinction will be awarded if the score is 80 or above.",
