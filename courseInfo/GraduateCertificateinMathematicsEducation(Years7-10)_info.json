        "Concepts and skills from the areas of Algebra and Number are used extensively across the mathematics curriculum, so these are offered as separate subjects, to acknowledge the importance of these content areas in their own right and also the critical role they play in supporting learning in Measurement, Geometry, Probability and Statistics.",
        "The mathematics proficiencies ofFluency,Understanding,ReasoningandProblem Solvingwill be addressed in each of the four subjects to highlight the interconnected nature of Mathematics and the need for students to develop these proficiencies across the curriculum.",
        "Participants will consider important pedagogical decisions in teaching Years 7-10 mathematics, including selection of good examples and explanations, representations and models for mathematical ideas, teacher questions, assessment, selection and use of resources and the role of digital technology and pen-and-paper in developing understanding. Participants will develop their capacity to plan effective lessons, design and interpret classroom assessment and plan a balanced curriculum.",
