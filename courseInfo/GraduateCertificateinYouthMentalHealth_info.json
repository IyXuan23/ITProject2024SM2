        "The Graduate Certificate in Youth Mental Health has been developed by the University of Melbourne's Centre for Youth Mental Health in collaboration with Orygen, a global leader in youth mental health research and knowledge translation, to build the capacity of the youth mental health workforce both nationally and internationally.",
        "The course is designed for education and health professionals working in a range of clinical and community contexts, and is intended to equip students with essential, foundational knowledge in youth mental health, covering major theoretical frameworks in the area, the various ways in which the transition to adulthood underscores young people's vulnerability to mental illness, and established frameworks regarding the causes, symptoms and best-practice interventions for non-psychotic mental illnesses experienced by young people. Students are also introduced to tailored engagement and assessment approaches to augment their existing skills when working with young people in a therapeutic or clinical context.",
        "The Graduate Certificate is delivered entirely online and can either be treated as a stand-alone qualification to contribute to professional development, or as an entry point for the more advanced Graduate Diploma in Youth Mental Health and Master of Youth Mental Health offered by the University of Melbourne."
