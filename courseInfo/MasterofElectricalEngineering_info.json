        "Overview",
        "Electrical engineers play a key role in the design, implementation and management of systems that exploit electrical phenomena to meet practical needs. These include systems for automation, surveillance, energy conversion, power distribution, telecommunications and information processing, on both very large and very small scales. Graduates are sought after for their strong analytical skills and they find employment in a variety of industries in roles ranging from research-and-development to project management and finance.",
        "Intended learning outcomes",
        "To produce graduates skilled in fundamental electrical engineering principles and the application of these to solve complex open-ended problems. Within this course, students acquire core skills in the areas of electronics, control, signal processing and communications, and can further specialise in one of autonomous systems, communication networks, electronics and photonics, low-carbon power systems or business.",
        "Distinction",
        "Upon completion of the Master of Electrical Engineering, it is possible for a student to be awarded Master of Electrical Engineering with Distinction provided a student has achieved a high level of academic performance. Eligibility of the Distinction award is dependent on a calculated distinction score.",
        "The distinction score will only take into account Level 9 subjects undertaken at the University of Melbourne. This means Study Abroad and Exchange subjects will not be considered. One 12.5 point subject with the lowest mark will be omitted in the calculation of the distinction score. All level 9 subjects with credit points of more than 12.5 points must be included in the calculations. Only marks from the first attempt at a subject will be used. The average mark will be weighted by the credit points of the subjects. A Master of Engineering with Distinction will be awarded if the score is 80 or above.",
        "Hurdle Requirement",
        "In order to achieve the Engineering Practice Hurdle requirement, students will need to document the attainment of professional skills at an adequate level. This may include the successful completion of any of the following:",
