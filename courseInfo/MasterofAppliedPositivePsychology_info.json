Through experiential learning approaches, students explore applications of the positive psychology perspective and wellbeing science with individuals, organisations, and communities. Multi-disciplinary empirical research is combined with thoughtful discourse, with a particular emphasis on contextual relevance, critical thinking, and understanding of the complexities involved in creating and sustaining positive change.",

As part of the learning and assessment processes, students are expected to engage in a range of conceptual, applied and research-informed tasks.
