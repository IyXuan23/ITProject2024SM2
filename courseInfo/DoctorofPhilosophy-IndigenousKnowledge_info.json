It shows that the candidate has a thorough grasp of the appropriate methodological techniques and an awareness of their limitations. The thesis also makes a distinct contribution to knowledge. Its contribution to knowledge rests on originality of approach and/or interpretation of the findings and, in some cases, the discovery of new facts.

It is a careful, rigorous and sustained piece of work demonstrating that a research apprenticeship is complete, and the holder is admitted to the community of scholars in the discipline.",
