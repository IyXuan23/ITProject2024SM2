        "The Master of Geography is a two-year, full-time degree that allows students to significantly extend their undergraduate specialisation in geography (or a related field). Students can specialise in one of three geography streams and chose either a coursework only option (no research project) or one of two coursework-plus-thesis options (with a 50 pt or 100 pt research project). The capstone experience is provided through the study of geography\u2019s methods and techniques applied to various geographic problems, as well as either the Geography Practical or Research Project. Discipline electives include numerous field-based subjects, where students gain field skills, which are at the heart of applied geography. Students opting for coursework plus research project choose a topic in a field of their choice under the supervision of one or more academic supervisors. The Research Project lays the foundations for possible PhD study or research-related positions in the workforce. The coursework component of the degree can be taken part-time; however, the 50-pt or 100-pt research projects must be taken over two or four consecutive semesters (respectively).",
