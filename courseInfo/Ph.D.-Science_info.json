        "The degree of Doctor of Philosophy signifies that the holder has undertaken a substantial piece of original research, which has been conducted and reported by the holder under proper academic supervision and in a research environment for a prescribed period.",
        "The PhD thesis demonstrates authority in the candidate's field and shows evidence of command of knowledge in relevant fields. It shows that the candidate has a thorough grasp of the appropriate methodological techniques and an awareness of their limitations. The thesis makes a distinct contribution to knowledge. Its contribution to knowledge rests on originality of approach and/or interpretation of the findings and, in some cases, the discovery of new facts. The thesis demonstrates an ability to communicate research findings effectively in the professional arena and in an international context. It is a careful, rigorous and sustained piece of work demonstrating that the PhD Graduand is admitted to the community of scholars in the discipline.",
        "In scope, the PhD thesis differs from a research Masters thesis chiefly by its deeper and more comprehensive treatment of the chosen subject. It is written succinctly, in English, unless approval has been given for the thesis to be written in a language other than English. The normal length of a PhD thesis is 80,000 words.",

            "1. Minimum qualificationsApplicants are normally required to have completed at least a four - year honours degree at H2A (75\u201379%) grade from an Australian university, or a qualification or combination of qualifications considered by the RHD Committee to be equivalent.",
            "2. Minimum level of academic achievementApplicants should have achieved an overall H1 (80\u2013100%) or H2A (75\u201379%) grade or equivalent, in the relevant Masters or honours degree.",
            "3. Relevance of the degreeThe completed degree must be in an area that is relevant to the intended PhD, including sufficient specialisation such that the applicant will have already developed an understanding and appreciation of a body of knowledge relevant to the intended PhD.",
            "4. Evidence of research abilityApplicants are normally required to have completed a research project, component, subject or group of subjects that accounts for at least 25% of their work (i.e. Honours year), or 25% of one year accumulated over the length of a Masters degree, and which has, or have, been conducted, and assessed, individually. Research carried out in groups should at least have been graded individually. This project, component, or subject(s) may include:",
            "any obviously research oriented project, subject or sustained piece of scholarly writing conducted for assessment, such as small theses, research essays, long essays, or studios; AND/OR",
            "any less-obviously research subjects, including practice-based subjects such as performance or fieldwork, where there is also scholastic rigor as documented in a sustained piece of writing analogous to (a); AND/OR",
            "any subjects directed at the formation of research skills, such as methodology and reasoning, such as scientific reasoning, or legal reasoning, where a sustained piece of writing has also been produced.",
            "5. Currency of applicant's knowledge of the disciplineThe applicant's degree(s) and/or professional experience must demonstrate that the applicant's knowledge of the discipline in which they plan to undertake their PhD is current. It is therefore expected that an applicant will have completed their tertiary studies and/or any relevant professional experience in the ten years immediately prior to their intended entry to the PhD.",
            "6. Assessment of suitabilityBased on interview or other verbal communication, an assessment should be made of the level of understanding, motivation and time commitment of the applicant for the proposed program of study. For example, a full-time candidate would be expected to devote at least 40 hours a week and a part-time candidate about half of this.",

The RHDC will not approve entirely distance supervision or entirely on-line supervision for graduate researchers.Throughout their candidature candidates are expected to attend the University in order to benefit from planning, conducting and writing up their research within a University community and environment.The residency requirement is deemed especially important during the period of probationary candidature.
