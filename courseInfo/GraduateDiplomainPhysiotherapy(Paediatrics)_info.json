Students studying the Graduate Diploma in Physiotherapy (Paediatrics) have the opportunity to progress to the 150 credit point Masters of Physiotherapy (Paediatrics).",
        "The course is a blended program that combines two intensive face-to-face subjects and six fully online subjects. Graduate attributes are aligned with those of The Melbourne Graduate; and further distinguished by established discipline-specific professional competency and standards frameworks in the domain of clinical paediatric physiotherapy. The curriculum is designed around three elements which will be covered explicitly within learning outcomes in each subject throughout the program: 1) Paediatric Physiotherapy Theory and Practice, 2) Evidence and Innovation and 3) Paediatric Physiotherapy Clinical Practice in Context.",
        "In this course, linking theory, research evidence and practice is emphasised, utilising scientific evidence to underpin paediatric physiotherapy clinical practice and decision making. The core subjects explore paediatric professional and clinical content in diverse contexts, as well as principles of evidence-based practice and research methodology, including research ethics. These subjects all require analysis, synthesis and creative problem solving within a range of practice contexts. Subjects extend knowledge and understanding, and introduce research principles and new innovations that are necessary to undertake clinical practice in different environments.",
