        "This Graduate Certificate will provide students seeking vocational specific skills, or professionals seeking skills development or new knowledge, with a deep understanding of the realistic functional benefits that urban green infrastructure can provide to many of the challenges in urban society. The suite of core and elective intensive subjects rely heavily on real life, problem-based learning to develop an applied science approach throughout the Graduate Certificate. This will better position recent graduates in the workplace, and better resonate with industry professionals through a case-study approach to the designed learning outcomes. The recommended subjects all build from a theoretical basis to the practical knowledge required to successfully develop green infrastructure strategies or plans, as well as practically manage the technical aspects of green infrastructure projects as well as local community participation, education and engagement.",
