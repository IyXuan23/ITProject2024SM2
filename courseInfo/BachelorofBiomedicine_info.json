        "The Bachelor of Biomedicine at Melbourne is designed to provide excellent education in a broad range of biomedical science and health-related areas of study. The course also equips graduates with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and participate in subsequent pathways to employment,research higher degreesand many professionalpostgraduate studyprograms.",
        "The integrated core of the degree builds understanding of the structure and function of the body and consideration of the determinants of health and disease, including genetic, societal and environmental influences.",
        "The course culminates in the final year with subjects that deal with contemporary issues in biomedical science and health, exploring aspects of medical conditions from the molecular level to cellular and population levels.",
        "Students are required to complete a total of 300 points of study, including 125 points of core subjects across the degree. Depth within a particular biomedical science or health-related discipline is achieved by completing 50 points (4 subjects) in a major at Level 3.",
        "Students also take between 50-75 points from other discipline, or \u2018breadth\u2019, study areas, including subjects in the arts, humanities, commerce and other breadth discipline areas . These subjects are designed to build knowledge and skills that bridge disciplines, including sharpening skills of logic, analysis and problem solving. These subjects offer students opportunity to further differentiate their degree."
