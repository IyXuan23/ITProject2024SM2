    "Overview text": [
        "The Graduate Certificate in Innovation Practice is designed to allow students who are interested in innovation to augment their post-graduate degree with practical and focused experiences through which they can learn more about innovation, improve their capabilities as innovators, and work with a sponsoring organisation to develop career-relevant professional skills.",
        "The Certificate is offered to students from across the university, creating a highly interdisciplinary learning experience.   A significant portion of that experience is focused around helping a sponsoring organisation achieve its innovation objectives.  Sponsors are drawn from the commercial, government (principally health) and research sectors.",
        "Specifically, the Certificate comprises three subjects.  You can bring two subjects from other programs to accrue credit towards the Certificate, or you can use these subjects to extend your interests and capabilities in Human Centred Design (one subject) and Innovation (second subject). The centre of the Certificate is the subject Prototyping for Commercialisation (ENGR90045).   In this 25-point subject, you will work in a team with some students (generally two others) and one representative of the project sponsor, to take an innovation concept through three rounds of prototyping.  After the first two rounds, you will validate it with users/customers. This subject will allow you to build knowledge and skills in prototyping, human-centred design, project management, teamwork, and sponsor management.  In addition, you will develop a relationship with the sponsor, and learn about the domain of the innovation.",
