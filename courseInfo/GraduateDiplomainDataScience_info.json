        "The management and analysis of big data are becoming increasingly important in commerce, industry and applied science. Due to the rapid development of technology, massive amounts of data are routinely collected from an increasing number of new devices and sensors. Data Science is a rapidly growing field sitting at the intersection of statistics and computer science that has evolved to address the need to organise, analyse and interpret data sets in many fields including biology, engineering, economics and finance.",
        "In the Graduate Diploma in Data Science students will acquire combined skills in statistics and computer science needed to keep pace with the rapidly changing needs of the modern job market in terms of data-analytic skills. This graduate diploma aims to strengthen students\u00b4 main area of expertise by equipping them with complementary technological abilities and analytical skills needed to manage and gain insights from large and complex collections of data. The graduate diploma also aims to provide the required knowledge in statistics or computer science for students who wish to further study data science in more advance master-level course. The program emphasises the use of statistical tools, techniques and methods along with in-depth analysis and evaluation, to solve real-world problems in the data realm.",
