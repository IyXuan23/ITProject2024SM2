        "Candidates for the Doctor of Agricultural Science (DAgrSc) have undertaken original scientific work to the extent that they have authoritative standing in that field and have made a substantial published contribution to Agricultural or Food Science. The work need not be limited to a particular field of research, but it would be expected that a particular field be covered in depth. Some unpublished work may be included.",
        "An applicant may provide their published work in an unbound submission to establish whether the work meets the criteria for acceptance of candidature. Publications are then put together to form a thesis which is examined by at least two examiners, one or both of whom are external to the Faculty of Science. The published contributions would in large part be original papers published in refereed journals of high standing.",
        "The University simply acts as an examining body for this degree and no time is spent as an enrolled candidate in the School of Agriculture, Food, and Ecosystem Sciences.",
