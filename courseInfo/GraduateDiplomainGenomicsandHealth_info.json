        "The Graduate Diploma in Genomics and Health is a nested award within the Master of Genomics and Health course.",
        "The Graduate Diploma in Genomics and Health will take a blended learning approach to delivery, combining online and face-to-face interactions. It requires completion of a total of 100 points of study and is structured to suit individual needs and study preferences. Students also have the option of enrolling in the Master of Genomics and Health course (200 points) and exiting with the Graduate Diploma (100 points), enrolling in the Graduate Diploma and exiting with the Graduate Certificate (50 points), or enrolling in the Graduate Certificate and subsequently articulating to the Graduate Diploma or Master.",
        "The rapid advances in genomics in the last decade are expected to bring about benefits in health care but are not without their challenges in terms of upskilling a workforce that is able to incorporate new ways of thinking about and applying genomics, as well as consideration of ethical and social issues.",
        "This Graduate Diploma in Genomics and Health course is the first course of its kind in Australia and students will engage in discourse around the current and potential impact on health and medicine brought about by these advances in genomics and genomic technologies.",
        "This course is designed to be available to students at different stages in their careers, including career starters and those who currently work and wish to further their knowledge, skills and qualifications. The coursework includes 75 points of compulsory subjects and allows some individual tailoring by offering students the choice of 2 elective subjects (25 points).",
        "Students who wish to transfer at any stage into the Master of Genetic Counselling must meet the course eligibility rules and successfully complete all of the compulsory subjects required for that stage of the Master of Genetic Counselling. This will only occur after approval from the Master of Genetic Counselling Curriculum Committee.",
