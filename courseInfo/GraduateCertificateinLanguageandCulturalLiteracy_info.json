        "The Graduate Certificate in Language and Cultural Literacy is designed to allow graduate students maximal flexibility in gaining an additional short qualification by undertaking introductory study across one or more subjects from a range of languages or to consolidate their knowledge of a language already begun. Students gain an understanding of intercultural communication through a core subject and through undertaking language and culture studies from any of 14 languages. They are able to package their own sequenced path of study, which can commence at different entry points (from beginners to advanced) depending on the student\u2019s existing level of proficiency.",
        "Students may combine studies across more than one language which will enable some students to build their skills in language and intercultural communication to meet personal or professional goals, for example in international relations or in diplomacy. Others will seek to specialise in a single language.",
        "Combining the two elements of language and transcultural communication/cultural literacy, the course is designed to appeal to a professional cohort as well as to existing students who may wish to commence language study with a view to possibly proceeding to more advanced study.",
