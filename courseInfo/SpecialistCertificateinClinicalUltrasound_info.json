    "Overview text": [
        "Clinical ultrasound (also referred to as ultrasound assisted examination, ultrasound guided procedures, bedside-, goal-focused-, focused-, point-of-care- and limited-ultrasound) improves clinical evaluation of patients and can be used to help guide procedures. Clinical Ultrasound is becoming widely accepted as a core component of clinical practice in health care. The Specialist Certificate in Clinical Ultrasound equips students with the fundamental knowledge essential to the practice of clinical ultrasound (in the core subject) and equips students with the interpretive skills required to perform clinical ultrasound in a chosen ultrasound modality, or modalities, specific to the health-care specialty of the student (through the elective subjects). The course also delivers the knowledge required to integrate these skills into clinical assessment and management of patients. The course provides knowledge on the process required for learning the practical skills of clinical ultrasound and information for those who wish to satisfy training requirements with their specialty college or credentialing body.",
        "The Specialist Certificate in Clinical Ultrasound contains elective ultrasound subjects designed for, but not limited to, health care professionals practicing in the areas of critical care (intensive care medicine, emergency medicine, anaesthesia), additional surgical and medical specialties, primary care health care, junior doctors, nursing and nursing subspecialties, physiotherapists, and paramedics.",
        "The course structure consists of interactive tutorials and practice in interpretation of online ultrasound cases of a wide range of pathology specific to the elective subjects.",
