        "The Specialist Certificate in Clinical Leadership (SCCL) provides clinicians with the leadership skills they need to improve their organisations, develop and implement change initiatives, and promote treatment quality and safety excellence within healthcare settings. The philosophy of the SCCL is to provide a contemporary, evidence-based program to health professionals to improve outcomes for their organisations, colleagues and patients. The program is targeted towards clinicians\u2014including doctors, nurses, dentists and allied health professionals\u2014who currently hold, or anticipate holding, leadership positions.",
        "This offering allows for the development of leadership skills required by the clinical work context. This is not a generic leadership program; it is embedded within the clinical context, taught largely by clinicians, and focused on clinical issues and challenges. Clinicians will be transformed as leaders alongside other clinicians who will share their experiences and enhance each other\u2019s learning. Clinicians who gain the University of Melbourne SCCL will be valued for their commitment to clinical leadership and their acquisition of skills that allow for the effective leadership of health organisations.",
        "The SCCL comprises two core subjects: 1) Leadership in the Clinical Setting and 2) Leading Healthcare Change for Impact. Course delivery will be through a combination of face-to-face intensive periods of teaching, supported by on-line resources. Assessments will be oriented towards outcomes that demonstrate the learning of leadership best practice within the clinical setting, and the ability to apply this learning to the clinical workplace."
