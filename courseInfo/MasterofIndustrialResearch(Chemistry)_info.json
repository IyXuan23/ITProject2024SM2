        "The Master of Industrial Research (Chemistry) is an innovative approach to the delivery of graduate research training. The degree offers research training integrated with and embedded within industry. Industry perspectives are incorporated into the curriculum and research project design through collaboration with industry partners and peak industry bodies which represent the broader discipline of Chemistry.",
        "The Master of Industrial Research (Chemistry) provides an alternative program for graduate researchers interested in pursuing an industry-based career as opposed to the traditional Graduate Research pathway which provides a clearer trajectory towards academia.",
        "Master of Industrial Research (Chemistry) candidates will gain industry-relevant research experience and develop professional skills including entrepreneurship, IP law, and chemical regulations frameworks. Graduates will be equipped with a strong theoretical understanding of relevant chemistry disciplines from targeted coursework, which will be taught through traditional methods of imparting knowledge from academics, but enabled through alternative teaching media including online delivery, short intensive modular subjects and traditional lecture style delivery where this is the most appropriate method for knowledge transfer."
