        "The Graduate Certificate in Early Childhood Research is a coursework program which provides an introduction to research methodology and enables participants to design and complete a research project with a focus on early childhood. Research throughout the course is about uncovering new ideas, understandings, and knowledges through collaborative and thoughtful design that is contextual and relevant to local and global communities. The course is suitable for practicing early childhood educators and teachers, school teachers, policy makers, administrators/directors and university academics looking to upskill, build their capacity in undertaking early childhood research, create informed and responsive policy and decisions, and engage in continuous improvement practices in classrooms and beyond.",
        "This course is delivered completely online and utilises the Collective Model to support students throughout the course. The Collective Model brings together students in small groups with a Collective Mentor (staff mentor/lecturer) who leads conversations connecting the subject content to the research process, builds understanding of the connection between research and teaching, and facilitates sharing experiences and discussing questions and ideas. Through the Collective, students build a strong relationship with a staff member and have a consistent support system.",
        "Note that this course is not equivalent to theGraduate Certificate in Educational Research(which is designed to prepare individuals for a graduate research degree)."
