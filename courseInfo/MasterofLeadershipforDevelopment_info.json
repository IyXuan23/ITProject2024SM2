        "The contemporary development leader requires new skill sets to meaningfully respond to, and effectively navigate complex circumstances and challenges that they encounter in the changing global environment including shifting patterns of work, prolonged crisis and conflict, and poverty and widening inequality.

Key thematic streams that run throughout each subject module allow students flexibility to develop or hone their skills within a specific area. While addressing important competencies such as communication, decision-making and self-reflection, the design of the subject modules ensures exercises and assessments are practical and applicable to students\u2019 professional leadership aspirations.",

The fully online programme provides the flexibility to study around your commitments and complete the course part-time over 24 months. The course embraces action-based, reflexive learning, facilitated through a comprehensive online platform, simulations, and individual and group projects. The course is designed to forge strong enduring networks among study fellows and alumni."
