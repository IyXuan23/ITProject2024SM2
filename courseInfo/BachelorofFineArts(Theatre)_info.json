Students have opportunities to engage in regional and national projects, undertake company residencies and be part of multiple public performance seasons.",
        "The program culminates in the creation and performance of fully produced devised works in which students collaborate in pre-professional companies to conceive, develop, rehearse and present original works. These works are showcased to invited industry guests and a general public audience.",
        "Students will learn from highly experienced staff and mentors and collaborate on a range of live and digital theatre making contexts with invited industry professionals. Previous projects have included students making original performance in the Royal Botanic Gardens, abandoned shops and emporiums in the CBD and in gallery spaces, as well as more traditional theatre spaces and studios. Theatre students also collaborate throughout the course with students from other disciplines and schools at the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) including students from Interactive Composition, Dance, Film and Television and Production.",
