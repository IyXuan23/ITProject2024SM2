        "Industrial engineers systematically transfer design and concept into tangible products and services, from design and production to business strategies and in a wide range of industrial systems, aiming to help ensure the competitiveness of firms. Students in this course develop a comprehensive set of skills in manufacturing technologies, system and simulation, operation and business management, and advanced manufacturing and operation techniques. Real-world projects and industry grounding activities help to consolidate theoretical knowledge and prepare students to undertake careers in industries from manufacturing and processing to healthcare, banking and consulting.",
        "Distinction",
        "Upon completion of the Master of Industrial Engineering, it is possible for a student to be awarded Master of Industrial Engineering with Distinction provided a student has achieved a high level of academic performance. Eligibility of the Distinction award is dependent on a calculated distinction score.",
        "The distinction score will only take into account Level 9 subjects undertaken at the University of Melbourne. This means Study Abroad and Exchange subjects will not be considered. One 12.5 point subject with the lowest mark will be omitted in the calculation of the distinction score. All level 9 subjects with credit points of more than 12.5 points must be included in the calculations. Only marks from the first attempt at a subject will be used. The average mark will be weighted by the credit points of the subjects. A Master of Industrial Engineering with Distinction will be awarded if the score is 80 or above.",
