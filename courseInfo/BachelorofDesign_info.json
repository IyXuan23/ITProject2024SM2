        "The Bachelor of Design is focused on the life-cycle of the constructed and inhabited world. Its application is wide ranging, from the macro-level of the metropolis to the construction of buildings, bridges and landscapes, to the small-scale of systems and micro-structures.",
        "Design is the unifying force that ties multiple disciplines together - from Architecture to Civil Systems, Computing and Software Systems (prior to 2023 called Computing), Construction, User Experience Design (prior to 2023 called Digital Technologies), Landscape Architecture, Mechanical Systems, Property, Digital Infrastructure Engineering Systems, Urban Planning through to Visual and Performance Design. Via completion of majors and electives taken from other disciplines within the degree, double majors, and specialisations, students will encounter design in a transdisciplinary and complementary manner. Students will be exposed to the spectrum of design \u2013 from the creative and imaginative, through to the algorithmic and policy-generated, to iterative and managed problem-solving.",
        "Design is the lens through which students will understand the constructed world and explore options for its future. In achieving this, students will demonstrate understanding of design processes and methods - identifying and analysing problems, synthesising ideas, prototyping and evaluating solutions and communicating outcomes as they apply to aspects of the constructed environments related to particular majors.",
        "Students will learn from internationally recognised scholars and industry professionals, and, as graduates, will have a broad understanding of the role of design in the contemporary world. Graduates will be ready to further their education with a professional Masters degree or be skilled to enter the workforce."

            "A candidate for the Bachelor of Design degree must have abilities and skills which include the following: observation; communication; motor; conceptual, integrative, and quantitative; and behavioural and social.Adjustments can be provided to minimise the impact of a disability, however students need to be able to participate in the program in an independent manner and with regard to their safety and the safety of others.Observation:A candidate must be able to read text, diagrams, maps, drawings and numerical data. The candidate should be able to observe details at a number of scales and record useful observations of environmental contexts.Communication:A candidate should be able to communicate with fellow students, professional and academic staff, members of relevant professions and the public. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing.Motor:Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from external contexts. Off-campus investigations may include visits to construction sites, urban, rural and/or remote environments. Candidates should have sufficient motor ability to prepare documentation of analytic texts, drawings and models of findings and for the preparation of proposals for environmental interventions via digital or other means. A candidate should have the ability to actively participate in appropriate site and/or design studio\u2010based activities.Intellectual\u2010Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities:These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of graduates, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three\u2010dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures.Behavioural and Social Attributes:A candidate must possess behavioural and social attributes that enable them to participate in a complex learning environment. Students are required to take responsibility for their own participation and learning. They also contribute to the learning of other students in collaborative learning environments, demonstrating interpersonal skills and an understanding of the needs of other students. Assessment may include the outcomes of tasks completed in collaboration with other students.Major\u2010specific core participation requirementsCertain Majors employ studio-based learning, which includes the requirement to present work and to receive critique and feedback publically. \u201cCrits\u201d are an integral part of working in the industry and are an inherent requirement of the course.The Bachelor of Design welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is the University and degree policy to take reasonable steps to make reasonable adjustments so as to enable a student\u2019s participation in the Bachelor of Design.Students who feel their disability will prevent them from meeting the above academic requirements are encouraged to contactStudent Equity and Disability Support(SEDS)."
