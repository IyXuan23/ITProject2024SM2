        "The Master of Genomics and Health is designed to prepare a workforce that is knowledgeable and skilled in practical, ethical and socially responsible implementation of genomics in health-related, community and policy settings.",
        "The rapid advances in genomics in the last decade are expected to bring about benefits in health care but are not without their challenges in terms of upskilling a workforce that is able to incorporate new ways of thinking about and applying genomics, as well as consideration of ethical and social issues.",
        "This Master of Genomics and Health course is the first course of its kind in Australia and students will engage in discourse around the current and potential impact on health and medicine brought about by these advances in genomics and genomic technologies.",
        "The Master of Genomics and Health will take a blended learning approach to delivery, combining online and face-to-face interactions. It requires completion of a total of 200 points of study and is structured to suit individual needs and study preferences. Students have the option of enrolling in a Master degree (200 points) or enrolling in or exiting with one of the nested awards Graduate Diploma (100 points), Graduate Certificate (50 points).",
        "This course is designed to be available to students at different stages in their careers, including career starters and those who currently work and wish to further their knowledge, skills and qualifications. The coursework responds to students by allowing individual tailoring to find the optimal approach.",
        "Note that the Master of Genomics and Health is not equivalent to a clinical Master of Genetic Counselling and will not fulfil the eligibility requirements by the Human Genetics Society of Australasia to undertake certification in genetic counselling.",
        "Students who wish to transfer at any stage into the Master of Genetic Counselling must meet the course eligibility rules and successfully complete all of the compulsory subjects required for that stage of the Master of Genetic Counselling. This will only occur after approval from the Master of Genetic Counselling Curriculum Committee.",
