        "The Master of Advanced Nursing Practice/Master of Public Health is a combined degree consisting of 200 credit points that combines both Advanced Nursing Practice and Public Health theory and practice. In undertaking this award, nurses will be equipped to assume future leadership roles and expand their scope of practice and reach into the health system. Upon graduating, students will be able to assume responsibility to lead health service developments and oversee dynamic changes to nursing practice in a way that creates change at a population level.  Graduates completing this combined degree will be empowered to address current and future global health needs and be very well prepared to participate in interdisciplinary teamwork and implement public health interventions.",
        "The program offers two pathways: A Research or Coursework pathway.  The Research pathway provides students with the opportunity to complete a supervised research project at the intersection of a public health specialisation and advanced nursing practice.  The Research pathway is designed to facilitate the student\u2019s eligibility for a higher research degree in the future. The Coursework pathway consists of two capstone subjects - Evidence in Practice and Implementing Evidence for Practice. The capstone experience allows students to consolidate their learning across the program, to appraise and synthesise the best available evidence to answer a clinical question arising from their practice and develop an implementation strategy to implement and monitor best practice.",
