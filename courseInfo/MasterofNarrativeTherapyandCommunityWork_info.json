        "The Master of Narrative Therapy and Community Work is a specialist graduate qualification for professionals interested in enhancing their clinical and practice-research skills. The degree prepares graduates for working with narrative approaches with individuals, families and communities, particularly in the areas of trauma and recovery.",
        "Narrative therapy is a respectful, non-blaming approach to counselling and community work, which centres people as the experts in their own lives. It views problems as separate from people and assumes people have many skills, competencies, beliefs, values, commitments and abilities that will assist them to reduce the influence of problems in their lives. Narrative approaches to therapy and community work are used by social workers, psychologists, community development workers, nurses, teachers, doctors, and other health professionals in a wide range of practice settings.",
        "The Master of Narrative Therapy and Community Work provides formal training and recognition for narrative therapy and is delivered as a joint initiative of the Department of Social Work (The University of Melbourne) and The Dulwich Centre, Adelaide. The Dulwich Centre is the international centre for narrative therapy training, established in 1984. Since this time the Dulwich Centre has led the development of narrative therapy that is now considered a mainstream modality in many contexts."
