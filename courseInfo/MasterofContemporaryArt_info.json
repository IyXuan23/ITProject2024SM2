        "The Master of Contemporary Art is a two-year, full-time postgraduate professional degree that serves as a bridge between undergraduate study and independent art practice, as a \"refresher\" program for artists who have been away from formal study, or as an entry point to further tertiary education for artists who lack formal qualifications but have significant professional experience, including those of recognised ability who have been unable to undertake or complete an Honours year.",
        "Tuition is conducted through a seminar programme and individual tutorials. Each student is assigned an Academic Advisor who is responsible for the oversight of the student's progress. The studio practice/project component is primarily conducted through individual tutorials and group tutorials/seminars. Students are encouraged to employ speculation and technical experimentation as learning strategies.",

        "The group tutorials/seminars are designed to generate critical discussion and debate on a more formal level with the student's peers, providing an initial forum for the analysis of the work and consideration of a range of issues surrounding contemporary art practice.",
        "Students in consultation with their academic advisor prepare an individual study proposal appropriate to their studio practice. The program should provide a conceptual framework for development and incorporate a study plan for acquisition of necessary skills.",
        "The capstone experience to the course is a year-long studio project in second year, culminating in a public presentation in the School of Art Masters Exhibition at the end of the year.",
