        "The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) signifies that the holder has undertaken a substantial piece of original research, which has been conducted and reported by the holder under proper academic supervision and in a research environment for a prescribed period.",
        "The PhD thesis demonstrates authority in the candidate's field and shows evidence of command of knowledge in relevant fields. It shows that the candidate has a thorough grasp of the appropriate methodological techniques and an awareness of their limitations.",
        "The thesis also makes a distinct contribution to knowledge. Its contribution to knowledge rests on originality of approach and/or interpretation of the findings and, in some cases, the discovery of new facts. The thesis demonstrates an ability to communicate research findings effectively in the professional arena and in an international context. It is a careful, rigorous and sustained piece of work demonstrating that a research 'apprenticeship' is complete and that the holder is admitted to the community of scholars in the discipline.",
        "In scope, the PhD thesis differs from a research Masters thesis chiefly by its deeper and more comprehensive treatment of the chosen subject. It is written succinctly, in English, unless approval has been given for the thesis to be written in a language other than English.",
        "Duration of candidature is 3 years for full-time candidates (6 years for part-time equivalent). Two extensions of 6 months each (12 months) may be permitted with advisory committee approval, equating to a maximum course duration of 4 years (8 years).",
        "The normal length of a PhD thesis is 80,000 words, exclusive of words in tables, maps, bibliographies and appendices. Footnotes are included as part of the word limit. The thesis should not exceed 100,000 words (or equivalent) without special approval from the Higher Degree Research Committee (HDRC).",
        "Candidates are expected to commence in February of their enrolling year."

            "4. \nEvidence of research ability Applicants are normally required to have completed a research project/component that accounts for at least 25% of their year's work at fourth year or at Masters level.\n",
            "5. \nCurrency of applicant's knowledge of the discipline The applicant's degree(s) and/or professional experience must demonstrate that their knowledge of the discipline in which they plan to undertake their graduate research degree is current.\n",
            "6. \nAssessment of level of suitabilityBased on interview or other verbal communication, an assessment should be made of the level of understanding, motivation and time commitment of the applicant for the proposed program of study. For example, a full-time PhD candidate would be expected to devote at least 40 hours a week to study and a part-time candidate about half of this.\n",
