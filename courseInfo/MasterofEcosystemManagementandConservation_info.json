        "The Master of Ecosystem Management and Conservation aims to prepare graduates for a wide range of ecosystem and landscape management employment pathways by preparing graduates with an understanding the biophysical and the social aspects of ecosystem management and how to function across local and landscape levels to address the problems of the future. The course seeks to development key practical and technical based skills sets as well as the knowledge and theories that underpin them creating graduates who can evaluate, collaborate and act. It is ultimately designed to prepare graduates for employment outcomes and will provide a cohort experience between graduates, teaching staff and practitioners to foster a connected and engaged coursework experience.",
