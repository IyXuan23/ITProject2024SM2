    "Overview text": [
        "This course will explore the emerging fields of Educational Neuroscience and The Science of Learning. Particular focus will be on how an understanding of the mechanisms of learning can inform and improve pedagogical practice and learning outcomes. The course will provide students with a broad understanding of the scientific method, the application of that method to the design, delivery and evaluation of learning interventions, along with the neural and cognitive mechanisms which underpin learning.",
        "Specifically, students will learn how neuroscience and psychology can, and can not be, successfully translated into classroom practice. More generally, students will also learn key scientific principles, and so be equipped with the skills to evaluate the validity of educational, psychological and neuroscientific research. These skills will allow students to become informed consumers of commercial educational products and methods, and enable them to critically reflect on their own teaching philosophies and practices."
