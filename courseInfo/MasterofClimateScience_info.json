        "Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of the 21stcentury. To face this challenge, society and industry require individuals trained to understand the climate system and apply that knowledge to help quantify, mitigate and adapt to climate risks. In this course you will apply your prior experience in other disciplines and gain the extra skills and knowledge required to develop advanced knowledge of physical aspects of climate science, climate change science, techniques and limitations of climate modelling, and climate policy.",
        "Graduates will have the skills to work in the growing field of climate risk, environmental consulting, become a working climate scientist, or combine their learnings with their prior degree to apply climate knowledge to a broad range of occupations. Graduates could also choose to pursue further studies in climate science as part of a subsequent research degree.",
        "Core knowledge and real-world application",
        "In this course you\u2019ll take subjects that provide you with advanced knowledge of physical aspects of how the climate system works and how and why it is changing. You\u2019ll then be able to tailor your degree to focus on the areas you\u2019re most interested in whether that be understanding climate change dynamics and extreme weather or learning how we can mitigate against ever more pervasive climate change impacts.",
