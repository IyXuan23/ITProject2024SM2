        "The Master of Environment (441ME) is a flexible, multidisciplinary course that enables students to develop knowledge and skills for professional practice in environment or sustainability. Depending on their academic background, interests and career aspirations students can choose from over 200 subjects taught by 10 different faculties. The Master of Environment provides both specialisation in a field of environmental practice and capacity to work across disciplines for environmental decision making. Students are provided with the opportunity to participate in research projects, internship placements, overseas study, and collaborative problem-solving projects",
        "The Master of Environment is a postgraduate qualification of 200 points (typically 16 subjects), normally taken in two years of study fulltime or part-time equivalent. Admission is based on scores in a relevant undergraduate program. The qualification structure requires completion of two core multidisciplinary subjects. Students complete a stream (typically fourteen subjects) in a defined specialist field of environmental knowledge, or may complete a tailored specialisation in a relevant field."

            "The Graduate School of Science (GSS) welcomes applications from students with disabilities. It is University and School policy to take reasonable steps to make reasonable adjustments so as to enable the student\u2019s participation in the School\u2019s programs. GSS contributes to the New Generation degrees and offers a broad range of programs across undergraduate and post-graduate levels many of which adopt a multi-disciplinary approach.",
            "Students of the School\u2019s courses must possess intellectual, ethical, and emotional capabilities required to participate in the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the School. Candidates must have abilities and skills in observation; motor in relevant areas; communication; in conceptual, integrative, and quantitative dimensions; and in behavioural and social dimensions.",
            "Adjustments can be provided to minimise the impact of a disability, however students need to be able to participate in the program in an independent manner and with regard to their safety and the safety of others.",
            "I. Observation:In some contexts, the student must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic and applied sciences. More broadly, observation requires reading text, diagrams, maps, drawings and numerical data. The candidate should be able to observe details at a number of scales and record useful observations in discipline dependant contexts.",
            "II. Communication:A candidate should be able to communicate with fellow students, professional and academic staff, members of relevant professions and the public. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing.",
            "III. Motor:Candidates should have sufficient motor function necessary for participation in the inherent discipline-related activities. The practical work, design work, field work, diagnostic procedures, laboratory tests, require varying motor movement abilities. Off campus investigations may include visits to construction sites, urban, rural and/or remote environments.",
            "IV. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities:These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of professionals in land and environment industries, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures.",
            "V. Behavioural and Social Attributes:A candidate must possess behavioural and social attributes that enable them to participate in a complex learning environment. Students are required to take responsibility for their own participation and learning. They also contribute to the learning of other students in collaborative learning environments, demonstrating interpersonal skills and an understanding of the needs of other students. Assessment may include the outcomes of tasks completed in collaboration with other students.",
