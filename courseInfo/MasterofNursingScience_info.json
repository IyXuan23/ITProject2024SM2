            "Students must comply with Fitness to Practice Rules, which are accessible fromSchedule 1of theStudent Fitness to Practice Policy (MPF1345).",
            "For the purposes of considering request for Reasonable Adjustments under the Disability Standards for Education (Cwth 2005), and Students Experiencing Academic Disadvantage Policy, academic requirements for this course are articulated in the Course and Subject Descriptions, Course and Subject Objectives, Generic Skills and Assessment Requirements.",
            "The Department of Nursing is committed to making reasonable adjustments to teaching and learning, assessment, clinical practice and other activities to enable students to participate in the MNSc course. However, reasonable adjustments must not fundamentally change the nature of the core participation requirements. The University is dedicated to provide support to those with special requirements. Further details on the disability support scheme can be found at the Disability Liaison Unit website:http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/",
            "It is a requirement of the course that students will be expected to physically examine their peers (of both genders) in classroom settings and patients (of both genders) in clinics and hospital wards.",
            "Nurses have a responsibility to maintain their physical and mental health, to practice safely and effectively (Code of Conduct for Nurses, NMBA, 2018). All students in the MNSc course must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical and emotional capabilities required to participate in the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence at graduation required by theMelbourne School of Health Sciences, Department of Nursingand theAustralian Health Practitioner Registration Agency(AHPRA). Nursing practice in Australia is bound by theRegistration Standards defined by the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Board.",
            "It is recommended that students read and understand the Professional Standards (http://www.nursingmidwiferyboard.gov.au/Codes-Guidelines-Statements/Professional-standards.aspx) and comprehend their responsibilities as a student. Students are automatically registered with AHPRA when enrolled in an entry-to-practice course and as such, are subject to the same regulations regarding professional conduct andmandatory reportingobligations.",
            "A student with a disability may be asked to provide independent medical or other clinical assessments of the disability and its possible impact on the ability of the student to successfully complete the course, before being accepted into the course. This statement would be treated in confidence with only those on the admissions committee and Disability Liaison having access to the document. (Deliberate misinformation about the student\u2019s ability to successfully complete the course will be regarded as unprofessional practice and treated as such.)",
            "While the Department of Nursing will make reasonable adjustments to minimise the impact of a disability, all students must be able to participate in the course in an independent manner. It is not reasonable for students to use an intermediary as an adjustment to compensate for a disability impacting on any of the five categories listed below. In the clinical environment, there is a primary duty of care to the patients, and the needs of students cannot compromise this. It is expected that all students will be able to participate fully in all classroom based learning activities and to successfully fulfil the clinical assessment and self-study requirements of the course. The presence of a disability will not automatically entitle the student to preferential treatment in clinical place allocation.",

            "Clinical Work: The student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the senses of vision, hearing and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell.",
            "2. Communication",
            "Practical Classes: The student must be able to hear and comprehend instructions in practical sessions and be able to clearly and independently communicate knowledge and application of the principles and practices of the subject during assessment tasks.",
            "Clinical Work: A student must be able to hear, speak to, and observe patients in order to elicit information and perceive nonverbal communications. A student must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients in both oral and written forms and in a culturally-competent and ethical manner. The student must also be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in both oral and written forms with all health care practitioners involved in patient management (including the use of telephones and computers).",
            "3. Motor",
            "Practical Classes: A student must be able to undertake the motor requirements for any mandatory practical sessions. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision.",
            "Clinical Work: Nursing is a physically demanding profession and requires coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision.",
            "Students should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by clinical examination, which may include palpation of the patient\u2019s body structures, active and passive movements of the patient, auscultation and other diagnostic manoeuvres.",
            "4. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities",
            "Practical Classes: The student is expected to have the ability to develop problem-solving skills and demonstrate this ability in practical sessions.
