        "The Graduate Diploma in Clinical Education takes the Graduate Certificate of Clinical Teaching\u2019s learner-centred approach and adds levels of flexibility and complexity intended to extend participants beyond their current level of competence. Deeper understanding of the principles of education and assessment is necessary for those who develop clinical examinations rather than just participate in them, and a focus on ensuring that participants are research-driven in their clinical education activities brings a level of opportunity to deepen their knowledge in areas that most apply to their current roles, or to broaden their skills and interests in order to take on new challenges. The Graduate Diploma in Clinical Education is designed as the next step for those who not only do the teaching but are involved in the planning and development of clinical education."
