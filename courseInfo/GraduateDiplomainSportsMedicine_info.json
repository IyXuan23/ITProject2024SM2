The Graduate Diploma core subjects explore professional and clinical practice relating to sport, exercise and injury in areas including athlete physiology, biomechanics & performance; sports injury prevention, diagnosis & management and athlete case management. Alongside 6 core subjects, the course includes 2 selective subjects enabling students to scaffold their learning according to their interest areas and practice context. These subjects all require analysis, synthesis and creative problem solving within a range of practice contexts; extended knowledge and understanding, research principles and new innovations that are necessary to undertake sports medicine practice in different environments.",
