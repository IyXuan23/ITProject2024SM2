    "overview": [
        "The Spanish and Latin American studies program at The University of Melbourne offers language options at all levels together with a variety of cultural studies subjects in fields as diverse as literature, cinema, popular culture, food studies and gender studies in Spain and Latin America.",
        "The Spanish and Latin American studies program will provide you with a wide range of opportunities to develop your Spanish language skills while increasing your awareness of Spanish and Latin American cultures through authentic written, spoken and audiovisual materials. You will also cultivate your intercultural competency interacting with the Spanish-speaking communities in Australia and abroad.",
        "Our program offers opportunities to undertake independent research projects with innovative scholars working in areas such as Hispanic food studies, Spanish and Latin American cinema, Latin American popular culture studies and translation. Beyond sound disciplinary skills students will be able to develop and enhance critical workplace skills, such as problem-solving, teamwork, clear communication, self-evaluation, mentoring, information literacy, professionalism and digital competency. You will be able to demonstrate your skills through a range of meaningful tasks developed along innovative assessment methods such as object-based learning, curation, process writing and project work in a variety of media (video, podcasts, etc.). A selection of your assessment tasks is housed in an ePortfolio, a valuable platform to showcase workplace skills, language level and intercultural competency achieved during your studies.",
        "The Spanish and Latin American studies program has agreements with universities in Spain and Latin America. They allow students to undertake exchange and study abroad options as part of their Spanish studies.",
        "Spanish language core subjects are organised in a progressive sequence from Spanish 1 to 7. The program also offers a range of Spanish electives in a variety of delivery modes, including our overseas intensives such as Tales of Muslim Spain, and the online winter intensive Realities and Fictions of Argentina. Our innovative elective Languages at Work offers students an additional opportunity to engage with industry collaborators in target-language communities in Australia.",
        "Students may enter at any point, subject to placement testing and/or prerequisites, and normally progress through the sequence in consecutive order. Accelerated progression and mid-year entry are also possible in special cases with the permission of the course convenor. However, mid-year entry is only possible into Spanish 2, 4 and 6. Students also have the opportunity to fast track their studies opting for the summer Intensive Spanish 3 & 4 subject."
