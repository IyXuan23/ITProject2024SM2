    "major name": "Microbiology",
    "overview": [
        "This major provides students with a detailed understanding of Microbiology, the study of microbial organisms. The major describes how infectious microbial agents are studied, the diseases they cause and their possible prevention or treatment. Aspects of our immune system, how it responds to protect us during infection, and vaccination are discussed. The major also describes how microbiology applies to a range of areas in the biomedical sciences. It opens up careers in infectious disease, diagnostics, molecular biology, biotechnology, vaccinology, antimicrobial chemotherapeutics, biosafety and regulation, as well as post-graduate research into infectious microbial agents, their genes and mechanisms of disease. It provides a basis for further study into medicine and other paramedical disciplines.",
        "Students intending to undertake this major should be aware that it requires successful completion of a practical-based subject in which products and reagents derived from animals are used."
