    "major name": "Anthropology",
    "overview": [
        "Anthropology is the study of people\u2019s common humanity as well as the extraordinary cultural and social diversity found around the globe. Its distinctive methodology, based on intense, long-term participation in people\u2019s daily lives, allows for ideas to develop out of local experience and knowledge. Contemporary fieldwork is as likely to take place in an urban tower block or tourist resort or moving with migrants or refugees, as it would be in a remote village in Africa or an island community in Melanesia. This major invites participation in subjects on: diverse ideas about the body; belief and religious practices; the growth of consumption and commodification, ethnic and national identity, and constructions of nature, sex, family and gender. The course we offer will expand your horizons by challenging your taken-for-granted understanding of the world, and it will also provide you with the skills needed to work successfully with people, to listen, to think critically, and to be fully engaged in an ever more expanding world."
