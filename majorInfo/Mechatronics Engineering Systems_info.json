    "major name": "Mechatronics Engineering Systems",
    "overview": [
        "This major provides a focused pathway for students wishing to build a career in the area of mechatronics, automation science and/or robotics. Students will develop strong skills in mathematical modelling of the behaviour, response, and control of mechanical systems that can perform physical tasks. This modelling is matched with sensing of the environment via electronic sensors and the instrumentation required to support them. The fundamental knowledge of the machine performance and sensing of the both the environment and performance can then be coupled using strong computer programming skills that are directed at interfacing the computers with machines.",
        "The primary pathway this creates for students is to a master of engineering course, although students with these skills at the completion of the BSc would also find career possibilities in a range of technical enterprises seeking strong problem-solving skills in machine-computer interaction."
