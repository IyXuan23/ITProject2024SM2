    "major name": "Integrated Water Catchment Management",
    "overview": [
        "Integrated Water Catchment Management is offered as a major field of study in the Master of Environment degree.",
        "With global climate change and more extreme weather conditions, water catchments have never been under more pressure, and professionals with skills in their management are in high demand.",
        "Catchment management involves the integration of sound biophysical information with social and economic analysis. This is used to achieve the best outcomes for a catchment's natural resources and the people who live and work there.",
        "Students studying this major will look into the functioning of catchments and the constraints to improving catchment management; particularly, how these constraints can be eased.",
        "Integrated Water Catchment Management is appropriate for professionals working in soil and water regulation, land management, and conservation in the private and public sectors.",
        "The major is suitable for students with a first degree in physical science, life science, social science, engineering, forestry, horticulture or agriculture. Professional geologists, natural resource scientists and managers who wish to gain advanced knowledge of catchment management strategies in urban and rural environments would also benefit from studies in this field.",
        "Students can expect to find employment in regulatory agencies, local and state government authorities, environmental consulting companies, and industries concerned with land development, recreation and tourism."
