        "The undergraduate program in Indonesian Studies comprises coursework designed to build students' knowledge and skills in understanding and analysing Indonesian language and society.",
        "Indonesian language subjects are organised in a progressive sequence (of units) from Indonesian 1 through to Indonesian 6, with 4 additional advanced units. Entry points are determined by the student\u2019s background in the language, placement testing, prerequisites, or at the discretion of the Indonesian Studies program. Students normally progress through the subjects in consecutive order. Mid-year entry is also possible, subject to appropriate prior experience and approval from the convenor of the Indonesian Studies program."
