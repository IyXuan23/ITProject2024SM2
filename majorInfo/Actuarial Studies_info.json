    "overview": [
        "Actuaries work in the assessment and management of the financial risks faced by insurance companies, superannuation funds and other entities. These risks include illness, disability or death of individuals, as well as risks to property (motor vehicles, buildings, etc.). The actuary\u2019s work is based on a multi-disciplinary background in mathematics, statistics, finance and economics.",
        "A major in Actuarial Studies will give you a firm grounding in the traditional actuarial skill set of mathematics, statistics, demography, finance and economics. Specifically, you\u2019ll learn from subjects covering actuarial techniques and life insurance modelling, through to the mathematics of finance and insurance risk models. This background, coupled with strong analytical skills, sees actuaries serving as financial advisers to a range of organisations including insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions, superannuation funds and governments",
        "The Centre for Actuarial Studies is accredited by the Actuaries Institute, which is the professional actuarial body in Australia. This accreditation means that students who complete certain subjects at the University of Melbourne, and achieve a sufficiently high standard, will be recommended for exemption from the corresponding subjects of the Actuaries Institute. Further details are available in the Students\u2019 Guide on the Centre for Actuarial Studies website:fbe.unimelb.edu.au/economics/ACT/courses/current_students",
        "The Faculty of Business and Economics is also designated as a Center of Actuarial Excellence by the US Society of Actuaries."

            "Students who are pursuing a major in Actuarial Studies must follow the mathematics pathway for their quantitative requirement. The first-year mathematics subjects are very important components of your actuarial program. We highly recommend that you enrol in MAST10008 Accelerated Mathematics 1 if you have the prerequisites, as the two Accelerated Mathematics subjects give a better preparation for second and third year Actuarial Studies. Decisions about entry into these and other mathematics subjects are made by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, not by the Centre for Actuarial Studies. If you are not able to enter MAST10008, it is recommended that you enrol in MAST10006 Calculus 2 in Semester 1, and then MAST10007 Linear Algebra in Semester 2.",
