    "overview": [
        "The Environmental Engineering Systems major focuses student learning on the interactions between physical materials and processes, and human and non-human organisms. Humans, through the engineering and operation of infrastructure inevitably have an impact on both the physical and biological world, which in turns feeds back to impact on humans. This major seeks to provide students with some fundamental tools from science and mathematics to be enable them to investigate, analyse, model and assess the impact arising from these interactions. Students who successfully master these tools will be in a strong position to apply them as environmentally literate scientists in industry, or to continue their study in the field of environmental engineering to become a professional engineer."
