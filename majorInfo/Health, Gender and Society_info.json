    "overview": [
        "It is well established that deep social inequalities undermine public health in societies across the globe.  These inequalities shape health outcomes, the experience of and access to health care, and the effectiveness of health promotion interventions.  In this specialisation you will learn how intersecting social structures and processes like colonialism and racism, patriarchy, capitalism and ableism drive disparities in health.  You will acquire tools to conduct meaningful research with communities to address wicked health problems and to jointly develop health interventions with the communities that have the most at stake in them. In this specialisation you will develop knowledge and skills in community engagement and health advocacy that look beyond notions of individual behaviour change to addressing the causes of inequity, and in developing solutions that contribute to fairer and healthier societies.  You will have the option of conducting a research project in an area of your interest with an expert in health sociology, medical anthropology, community psychology, social epidemiology, gender, women\u2019s health, ethics, disability, justice health and children\u2019s participation. Possible roles open to students who complete this specialisation include health promotion officer, community development officer, community health and engagement officer, environmental health officer, health policy adviser, technical adviser and research officer.  Organisations employing graduates with the skills developed in this specialisation are diverse.  Past graduates have gone on to positions with local, state/provincial and federal governments; national and international non-government organisations; community-based organisations; UN agencies; think tanks and advocacy organisations; universities and research institutes; health and social care service providers; as consultants in the private sector; and to entry into higher degree research programs.",
