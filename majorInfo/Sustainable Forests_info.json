    "overview": [
        "Sustainable Forests is offered as a major field of study in the Master of Environment degree.",
        "Forest landscapes and ecosystems have a massive impact on all our lives as evidenced by the 2009 bush fires in Victoria. The Sustainable Forests major looks at issues related to management of carbon, water, fire and biodiversity at landscape scales in relation to forests with a view to making them more sustainable. We study the challenges of fire management, the role of forests in climate change management, environmental policy and timber and non-timber production.",
        "Students in this specialisation will understand: biological, economic, social and environmental factors that impact on forests; the development of forest and natural resource management enterprises both in Australia and internationally; and carbon sequestration and water resource management.",
        "Students can expect to develop skills in forest ecosystem sciences; sustainable forest management; and the design, conduct and analysis of forestry research.",
        "Suitable for professionals and aspiring entrants to the forest and natural resource management sectors, we will prepare you for middle and upper management positions within the forest and natural resource management and provide a pathway to further study."
