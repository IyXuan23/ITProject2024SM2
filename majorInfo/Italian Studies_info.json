    "overview": [
        "Italian is one of the world\u2019s most important languages strongly influencing languages and cultures around the world. A knowledge of Italian opens up access to a wide range of areas, including history, art, music, as well as to other languages, such as French and Spanish. The overall objective of the Italian Studies program is to teach students to process information from a wide variety of materials in Italian, both written and spoken, and to produce accounts and discussions of that information in a variety of forms. In subjects at all levels, you will be guided towards undertaking independent research projects into areas including language, literature, politics, cinema, theatre, travel writing, food and wine, immigration and identity.",
        "Italian language subjects are organised in a progressive sequence (of units) from Italian 1 through to Italian 6 and beyond. Entry and exit points are determined by the student\u2019s background in the language, placement testing if required, prerequisites, or at the discretion of the Italian Program. Students normally progress through the subjects in consecutive order. Mid-year entry is also possible into subjects with even numbers, subject to appropriate prior experience and approval from the head of the Italian Studies program. Accelerated progression is possible on advice from the Italian Studies program."
