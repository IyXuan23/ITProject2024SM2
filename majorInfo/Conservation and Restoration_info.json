    "overview": [
        "Conservation and Restoration is offered as a major field of study in the Master of Environment degree.",
        "Biodiversity loss is one of the key environmental challenges globally. Sustainable societies depend on successful conservation and restoration of this diversity, at genetic, species, community and landscape scales.",
        "Students will explore the biophysical and social factors shaping endeavours to conserve and restore wildlife and vegetation. They will develop skills for planning and managing biodiversity at species, community and landscape scales. The cross-faculty teaching program ensures students have a sound understanding of the ecological principles underpinning conservation and restoration, and an appreciation of the political and community dimensions of establishing and implementing these plans.",
        "The major is suitable for people with undergraduate studies and/or professional work experience in life sciences, forestry, natural resource management, agriculture, parks and wildlife management, and environmental engineering. It is also an appropriate major for government and industry professionals working in conservation and development who are looking to upgrade or link their skills to environmental management.",
        "Graduates can expect to find employment in regulatory agencies, local and state government authorities, environmental consulting companies, and industries with international interests in developing economies"
