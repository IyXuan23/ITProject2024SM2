        "The Master of Public Health (MD) is offered to students enrolled in the MD at the University of Melbourne. This program is designed for those students who wish to combine future medical practice with work that protects and improves the health of communities through education, primary prevention, reform and research. This recognizes the need to produce outstanding graduates that have the ability to address growing disparities in health care, health promotion and the global burden of disease. The MD/MPH is fully integrated, allowing students to undertake the MPH between the third and fourth year of the MD program so that they might develop public health interests as an integral part of their medical training.",
        "Applicants apply to undertake the MPH component of the MD/MPH at the start of the MD-Year Three. After being accepted students take a leave of absence from the MD program at the end of third year, complete their MPH coursework and return for the final stage of the MD program one year later. This pathway is not available to students who have already completed the MD and quotas may be applied to both CSP and fee-based enrolments.",
        "Students currently enrolled in their first year of the Master of Public Health (MPH)who havebeen successful in gaining entry to the MD are eligible for entry to the MD-MPH Intercalated degree providing they have completed POPH90217 Foundations of Public Health, POPH90013 Biostatistics, POPH90014 Epidemiology 1, POPH90231 Qualitative Research in Public Health, POPH90274 Prioritising & Planning Public Health and Five Elective Subjects.
