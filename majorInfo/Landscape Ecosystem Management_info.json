    "major name": "Landscape Ecosystem Management",
    "overview": [
        "The Landscape Management major explores rural and urban ecosystems and the human activities that shape these systems. Parks and public open space, protected areas, residential environments, forests and agricultural landscape provide important ecological, amenity and social values, affording, for example, biodiversity, recreation opportunities and economic products such as food production or housing. The major will provide students with an understanding of how these landscapes function, and their use and importance to society. Students will develop an understanding of physical and social components of landscape such as plants, fauna, soils, water, social and economic sub-systems and the complex interrelations between these. Throughout the major, understanding of ecosystems is explored in the context of management issues and strategies, allowing students to develop skills for professional practice in landscape management.",
        "Careers and Further Study",
        "Through its emphasis on solution based learning and practical field work, the landscape management major provides an academic basis for employment in horticulture or natural resource management. It also offers a pathway to professional graduate programs such as the Master of Urban Horticulture, Master of Forest Ecosystem Science and the Master of Environment. For more information on these graduate programs please visit the Melbourne School of Land and Environment web site:http://land-environment.unimelb.edu.au/graduate/"
