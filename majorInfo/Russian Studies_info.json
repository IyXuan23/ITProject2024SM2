    "overview": [
        "Russian is one of the world's major international languages: it is spoken by over 140 million people and is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. A knowledge of Russian may increase access to careers in international relations, development studies, business, science and the arts.",
        "The overall objective of the Russian Studies program is to teach students to process information from a wide variety of materials in Russian, both written and spoken, and to produce accounts and discussions of that information in a variety of forms.",
        "The core Russian language subjects are organised in a progressive sequence from Russian 1 through to the Capstone subject. Entry and exit points are determined by the Russian Studies program based on the student\u2019s background in the language, placement testing or prerequisites. Students normally progress through the subjects in consecutive order. Mid-year entry is also possible into subjects with even numbers, subject to appropriate prior experience and approval from the head of the Russian program. Accelerated progression is possible on advice from the Russian Studies program."
