        "This is an interdisciplinary major that provides education in using computational and quantitative methods to address scientific questions at the interface of the life, mathematical, and computational sciences. There is great demand for computational and mathematical biologists in academia, industry, and government, where they are investigating problems as diverse as identifying the genetic basis of disease, to predicting how ecological systems will respond to climate change.",
        "In addition to completing core units that provide essential education in computational biology, students have the opportunity to specialise in one of computational biology\u2019s core disciplines \u2013 the life sciences, mathematics and statistics, or computer science.",
        "The major prepares students for graduate studies in either computational biology or traditional disciplines, as well as for entry into the job market."
