    "overview": [
        "Energy Studies is offered as a major field of study in the Master of Environment degree.",
        "The amount of energy we consume as a global society is immediately impacted by the technologies we use to consume that energy, and how that energy is produced.",
        "The Energy Studies major is concerned with the theoretical and practical needs of professionals working in energy use and planning. A range of technologies, both mainstream and non-conventional, can be used for energy supply. We study these technologies and how they can be applied in energy planning and energy end use. We also examine the social and political factors influencing the acceptance of energy technologies.",
        "The Energy Studies major is a great way of accessing elements of an engineering education for students with an undergraduate degree in other disciplines. Graduates can expect to find employment in energy agencies, utility companies, industry, education, and consultancy."
