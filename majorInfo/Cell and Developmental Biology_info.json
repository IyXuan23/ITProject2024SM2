    "overview": [
        "This major provides students with broad understanding of cell structure and function and explores genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms of development in a range of organisms and experimental models. It highlights the research methodologies used and how knowledge is applied to improve the human condition. Students should develop specialist skills in understanding cellular processes and experimental approaches used to investigate them. They should also develop generic skills in integrating information from diverse fields, communication and presentation of information, teamwork and independent learning that will equip them for a range of careers in research, biotechnology, government agencies, agriculture, medico-legal and journalism."
