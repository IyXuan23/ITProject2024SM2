        "THE COURSE STRUCTURE BELOW ONLY APPLIES TO RE-ENROLLING STUDENTS WHO COMMENCED THEIR STUDIES PRIOR TO 2016",
        "Engineering involves the planning, design and construction of the built environment for the provision of essential services and infrastructure in a manner that respects and works with the natural and social environmental contexts in which it occurs. Engineers use their sophisticated understanding of these concepts to create solutions to improve quality of life. This major provides you with the interdisciplinary skills necessary to succeed in this complex and exciting field. Given the critical link engineers create between society, the built and natural environments, this major draws upon one of the key strengths of the Bachelor of Environments \u2013 its interdisciplinary approach to problem solving \u2013 to build your teamwork skills. You will learn how to work with a range of specialists, such as architects, biologists, ecologists, natural resource managers, planners, community groups, farmers and other engineering disciplines, in order to establish sustainable and resilient human-environment systems. This major is based on a strong ability in mathematics and science to learn how to develop predictive models of complex systems to allow design of engineered systems.",
        "Careers and further study",
        "Students pursuing a career in engineering will complete the Bachelor of Environments with a major in Engineering Systems, followed by the two-year Master of Engineering (Civil, Environmental or Structural). The five-year Bachelor-Master combination leads to professional accreditation by Engineers Australia, the Washington Accord and Eur-ACE, the European accreditation system for professional engineers. For more information on the Masters of Engineering and graduate careers, please visit the Melbourne School of Engineering web site:www.eng.unimelb.edu.auEnvironmental engineering graduates specialize in land, water, energy or waste management; site contamination; river rehabilitation; soil erosion; renewable energy and other environmental issues. Civil and structural engineering graduates work in construction engineering, building structural design, transport and traffic, earthworks, hydraulic systems, and project management. Many graduate engineers also find demand for their strong analytic problem solving skills in a range of business and management careers.",
