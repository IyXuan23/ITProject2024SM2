    "overview": [
        "The Finance major is the study of money management. Finance professionals manage assets to create wealth for investors or companies. When dealing with investments, it's about considering the time between investment and future payoff - and the risks attached to these future payoffs. The finance discipline examines how these organisations raise funds to implement investment strategies, and how they allocate these funds to a variety of investment opportunities. This involves the application of economic analysis, accounting concepts and quantitative methods to solve financial problems, assess risks and make financial decisions.",
