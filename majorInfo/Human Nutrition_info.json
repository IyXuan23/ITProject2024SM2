    "overview": [
        "The major in Human Nutrition will prepare graduates for careers in areas including the food industry, government regulatory authorities, dietetics and secondary school teaching (the latter two requiring further qualifications), as well as a pathway to higher degrees in nutrition research and many other health related fields. Basic sciences underpin this major, which connects the science of agriculture, to food production and processing, the nutrient composition of foods, the interaction of those nutrients with our biochemical and physiological make up and the impact of diet in general on health and disease at the individual and population level. The major may also form a pathway into Masters of Dietetics at universities within Australia. Completion of the Nutrition Major will qualify students for registration within the Nutrition Society of Australia's Voluntary register of nutritionists. Students completing the major may be eligible to apply for Honours in Human Nutrition."
