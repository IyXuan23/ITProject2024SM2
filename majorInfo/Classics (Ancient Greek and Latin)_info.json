    "overview": [
        "Classics is the study of the languages Ancient Greek and Latin, which have been taught at the University of Melbourne since its very foundation and have been a core element of higher education for many centuries. The overall objective of the Classics program is to introduce students to key literary texts from classical antiquity (including history, drama, oratory, philosophy, epic, and lyric poetry), and to enable students to discover the many important contributions which reading ancient texts in the original languages can make to understanding both the ancient world and the Western tradition. Knowledge of Ancient Greek and Latin is also very useful for research and training in such related disciplines as biochemistry, medicine, the history and philosophy of science, archaeology, Biblical studies, history, philosophy, art history, Romance language studies, English literary studies, and music.",
        "Students who major in Classics may progress through one or both of these languages from beginners level (entry point 1) and are encouraged to take subjects in both languages. Students who have completed one of these languages at VCE may begin studying the language at entry point 3 and are required to commence studying the other classical language at level 1 (entry point 1).",
        "Students who are interested in pursuing a Classics major are highly advised to seek advice from the Coordinator regarding the appropriate study plan."
