    "overview": [
        "A specialisation in Integrated Geography will provide students with skills and conceptual frameworks about the processes that shape the world around us. Students will investigate and seek to understand the dynamic relationships between societies and environments, why these relationships are the way they are, how and why they are changing, and how and why their characteristics vary over time and space. Integrated Geography combines elements of physical and human geography and as such, it is a globally-minded discipline that seeks to understand the complex connections between people and place in order to work towards a more equitable world.",
        "Geography is a field-based discipline, enabling students to gain hands-on research experience via practical laboratory classes, field trips, and group project work, whilst also being provided opportunities to develop critical intellectual skills, transferable professional skills, a sense of public responsibility and higher research degree capacities.",
        "Completion of the Graduate Diploma with a specialisation in Integrated Geography will allow students to enter careers in the following areas: research institutions, teaching, environmental sciences, resource management and planning, environmental consultancies, industry and all levels of government.",
        "The Graduate Diploma (Integrated Geography specialisation) also provides a pathway into the Master of Geography."
