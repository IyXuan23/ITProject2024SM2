    "overview": [
        "Climate Change is offered as a major field of study in the Master of Environment degree.",
        "Climate change mitigation and adaptation are increasingly being integrated into business management, government policy and technology design, requiring expertise in a range of fields including international conventions, strategic government and business policy, climate science, energy technology, economic analysis and management. Effective solutions therefore require a new generation of policymakers, managers and scientists equipped with a multidisciplinary understanding of climate change issues.",
        "The Climate Change major is ideal for students seeking an interdisciplinary perspective on climate change, for work in policy-making or business advisory roles. Graduates will be well-placed to offer leadership through a solid understanding of: theoretical and practical applications of policy and science; technological limits, potentials and risks; and the value of addressing a wide-ranging global environmental issue from a trans-disciplinary perspective.",
        "Additionally, this major presents an opportunity for students to establish extensive networks with fellow climate change professionals across a broad range of industries, sectors and fields of endeavour.",
        "Graduates of this major can expect to find employment in State and Federal Government authorities, environmental consulting companies, business advisory and strategic policymaking positions worldwide"
