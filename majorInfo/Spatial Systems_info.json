    "overview": [
        "Spatial Systems is the study of the science and technologies of 3D measurement, mapping and visualisation. This major provides the opportunity to acquire skills in modern, sophisticated technologies such as global positioning system (GPS), three dimensional computer visualisations, geographic information systems (GIS), surveying, and satellite and photographic image processing.",
        "Careers and Further Study",
        "Students pursuing a career in Spatial Systems will complete the Bachelor of Environments with a major in Spatial Systems, followed by the two-year Master of Engineering (Geomatics). The five-year Bachelor-Master combination leads to professional accreditation by Engineers Australia and the Institution of Surveyors, Australia.
