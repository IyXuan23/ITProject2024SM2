    "overview": [
        "The Hebrew and Jewish Studies program offers an unparalleled opportunity to study the development of Jewish civilization, Israeli history and culture, and the study of the Hebrew language. Hebrew and Jewish Studies investigate the history, literature, archaeology, philosophy, ethnography and social theory of Jewish society and culture. Students are encouraged to engage in contemporary debates about ethnicity and identity, assimilation, exile and Diaspora cultures. Students benefit from the interdisciplinary breadth and the opportunity to combine this with options in Hebrew language study which is taught from beginners to advanced level. Students explore topics that draw on extensive archival resources available in Australia and internationally."
