    "overview": [
        "The Master of Development Studies (specialisation in Gender & Development) provides specialist training and a professional qualification for graduates who are working, or seeking to work in international and community development, especially for those with an interest in gender and development. The program is designed to give students a firm grounding in theories about gender and development and enable them to think critically, reflexively and creatively about gendered policy and programming. The integration of theory and practice in our curriculum will help students develop capacity for gender analysis of important cross-cutting themes in development such as poverty, inequality, social justice, conflict and security, environment and livelihoods, and mobility and displacement. High achieving students who complete the thesis option may qualify for entry to a masters by research or a PhD.",
