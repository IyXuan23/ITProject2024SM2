    "overview": [
        "Honours in Vision Sciences is a programme across two semesters designed to extend the student\u2019s knowledge and skills through a supervised research project together with advanced coursework in the vision sciences. The research component will involve the student conducting an original research project in one of the laboratories of the Department of Optometry & Vision Sciences under the supervision of one or more academic staff from February to November. The research will be of a level that can potentially contribute to a publication, whether on its own or as part of a larger project. The coursework component will introduce students to current literature in the vision sciences and the various techniques used in different laboratories. There will be an emphasis also on developing the student\u2019s communication skills both orally and in writing. The course year starts in February and ends in November and is only available full time.",
