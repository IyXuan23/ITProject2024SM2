    "overview": [
        "The University of Melbourne Department of Paediatrics offers an Honours Course in collaboration with its campus partners at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital. Many diverse and exciting research programs are available on campus and include laboratory, clinical and public health research. The Honours subject provides students with the opportunity to design and conduct a biomedical research project, under supervision, in any one of these areas. Students will develop their own research project through hypothesis testing, experimental design and practical experimentation, statistical analysis, data interpretation and dissemination of the research findings via podium and written presentations. A molecular background in at least one of Biochemistry, Genetics, Biology or Anatomy & Cell Biology subjects is strongly recommended. The course year starts in February and ends in November and is only available full time.",

        "In addition to satisfying the Bachelor of Science (Degree with Honours) entry requirements, students are required to have completed stream specific prerequisites.
