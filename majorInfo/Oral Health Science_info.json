        "The Honours year is a valuable addition to your Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Biomedicine degree. Honours graduates obtain skills and qualifications which can lead to higher education degrees such as a Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy. An Honours degree is also a strong entry point into careers in science, medical research and industry.The Honours year with the Melbourne Dental School is designed to provide opportunities for you to gain an understanding of the practice of biomedical research, and to teach you how to:\u2022 design a scientific project and consider ethical principles and processes used in biological research;\u2022 locate and utilise information available in scientific and medical literature, and ensure an understanding of experimental data in order to construct a rational scientific argument;\u2022 introduce the student to research techniques and enable them to apply the techniques to a specific project;\u2022 enhance problem solving skills by undertaking methodological approaches to research;\u2022 establish time management skills and to manage the completion of specific tasks;\u2022 collect and critically analyse information, including statistical assessment of experimental data;\u2022 communicate research results in both written and oral form, including the organisation of knowledge and identification of the potential scope of the research project.",
        "Most students start their studies at the beginning of Semester one (February), although mid-year entry (August) is also a possibility.",
        "Admission requirements",
        "In addition to satisfying the Bachelor of Science (Degree with Honours) entry requirements, students are required to have completed stream specific prerequisites.
