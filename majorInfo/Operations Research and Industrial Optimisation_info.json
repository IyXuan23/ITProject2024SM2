        "The Master of Science (Mathematics and Statistics) is a coursework masters degree incorporating a substantial research project.",
        "The course is a flexible program that allows students to study subjects across Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Physics, Physical Combinatorics, Operations Research, Discrete Mathematics, Statistics, Probability and Stochastic Processes. Subjects are taught at an advanced level and form an ideal preparation for research in Mathematics and Statistics, including doctoral (PhD) studies.",
        "The Master of Science (Mathematics and Statistics) also gives students the opportunity to undertake a professional skills component, and is a pathway to PhD study or to the workforce.",
