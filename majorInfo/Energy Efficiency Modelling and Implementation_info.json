    "overview": [
        "Energy Efficiency Modelling and Implementation is offered as a major field of study in the Master of Environment degree.",
        "Energy modelling and implementation for buildings has become an important area in the light of growing concerns about climate change, energy security and the general need to adopt more sustainable practices. Despite the obvious need for people with such knowledge, there is a severe shortage of people that are trained in energy modelling who have the capacity to interpret the modelling results to effective practice. The realms of energy knowledge required include heating and cooling requirements, as well as use of day lighting and natural lighting. These skills are crucial to being able to reduce the risk in the integration of innovative sustainability initiatives, this risk reduction centres on assurances of performance and delivery of desired sustainability outcomes.",
        "Energy modelling is a key tool for the development and adoption of energy efficiency in new and existing buildings. This course develops the skills of complex modelling informed by an understanding of the results ensuring the graduate has the ability to both interpret and communicate outcomes effectively. Units of study include a mix of building management, architecture, engineering, management, and education and communication subjects."

Students in the 200 point pathway willapply this knowledge to a project including research of alternative retrofit options, testing, analysis and scholarly writing of the results. This research or internship project subject will be selected from a list of available research project subjects and must have a minimum weight of 12.5 points. Students in the 100 point pathway will not normally be required to complete this component. Students choose subjects from a recommended list of electives to make up the balance of the award.
