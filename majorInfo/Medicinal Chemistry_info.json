    "overview": [
        "Students who complete the Graduate Diploma (Medicinal Chemistry specialisation) will develop the capacity to view the world from a molecular perspective and will have the ability to solve complex problems that span the breadth of chemistry and other sciences with a focus on medicinal chemistry. The pharmacology component introduces students to the unified study of the interaction between chemical agents and living matter. Pathways for Graduate Diploma (Medicinal Chemistry specialisation) students will include careers in research (through further study including MSc and PhD programs in chemistry and allied areas), teaching, government and professional positions."
