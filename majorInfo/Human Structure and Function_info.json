    "overview": [
        "The Human Structure and Function Major will explain how the human body works, based on a deep understanding of the relationship between physiology and anatomy. The subjects are structured so that the anatomy (structure) and physiology (function) of the human body are taught in carefully integrated units that also introduce elements from pathology, pharmacology and zoology as relevant. It will suit students entering: medical and health related sciences, postgraduate research work in applied anatomy and physiology; teaching and research in University departments and in hospitals; with pharmaceutical companies; in media liaison, consultancies and scientific journalism."
