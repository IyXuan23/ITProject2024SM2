    "major name": "Electrical Engineering Systems",
    "overview": [
        "Completing the Electrical Engineering Systems major will enable students to rigorously integrate the mathematics of signals, systems and information with the science of electrical phenomena in the formulation and solution of problems in areas such as telecommunications, monitoring and automation, energy distribution, and digital computing. We aim to develop: scientific understanding of electrical phenomena as a basis for mathematical modelling and abstraction in analysis and design; problem-solving and design skills; the ability to construct simulations and laboratory experiments; and good communication skills. The major opens pathways that lead to accredited professional careers in electrical engineering (through the Masters of Engineering), as well as careers in applied mathematics, applied science, teaching, management and finance."
