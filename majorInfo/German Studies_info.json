    "overview": [
        "German has more than 100 million native speakers and is the third most popular foreign language world-wide. Knowledge of German opens up the rich culture of German-speaking Europe as well as its history, philosophy, literature, music and scientific traditions. The German Studies program has a proud history of more than half a century at the University of Melbourne and provides students with the opportunity to complete part of their studies overseas through scholarships and exchange programs.German language subjects are organised in a progressive sequence of units from German 1 through to German 10 and has four entry points (German Studies 1, 3, 5 and 7). Placement in the correct entry point is determined by the German Studiesprogram, based on the results of the online placement test. Hence all students who enrol in German at The University of Melbourne for the first time need to undertake the placement test. Thereafter students normally progress through the sequence in consecutive order. Accelerated progression is possible with the permission of the course convenor. Mid-year entry is also possible into subjects with even numbers."
