    "major name": "Climate and Weather",
    "overview": [
        "This major will equip you with the skills and knowledge to understand the complexities of our weather and climate, how they vary, and how they will change in the future. The major brings together knowledge from physics, mathematics and chemistry, and applies it to the fields of meteorology and climate science. Completing this major will allow students to understand and explain the fundamental processes that create our weather; lead to storms, cyclones, and other hazards; and combine with natural variations and anthropogenic emissions to change our global and regional climates. You will also learn about the techniques used to build state-of-the-art weather and climate models, understand how they are used, and their limitations.",
        "The major opens doors for careers in meteorology, weather prediction, climate change science, environmental consulting, and research. Employers include CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology, the aerospace industry, local, state and federal governments, and a range of management and environmental consulting firms. Combine studies in meteorology and climate science with other disciplines to improve your knowledge of climate change and its relevance for other sectors."
