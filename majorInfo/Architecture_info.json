        "Architecture is a discipline that uses broad skill sets. The Bachelor of Environments is an ideal degree on which to build an architectural career that is relevant to the 21st Century. Increasingly architects need to be able to work effectively with multidisciplinary teams. As an Architect students will need to be expert at creating innovative solutions for complex and often conflicting scenarios. The contemporary issues that confront designers include climate change, globalisation, urbanisation and new technologies. While difficult, they are also opportunities to inspire and inform your education and your future practice as an architect.",
        "Design lies at the heart of the architectural process and is underpinned by expertise in history, theory, environmental and construction technology and communication. In the Architecture major of the Bachelor of Environments students will learn to develop their designs using modelling and rendering techniques through studio-based classes, contributing to a creative and challenging learning experience.",
        "From 2016 double majorsare available for certain majors within the Bachelor of Environments. Further information on double majors can be found here:http://edsc.unimelb.edu.au/double-majors.",
        "Careers and Further Study: Upon completion of the Bachelor of Environments with a major in Architecture, students will have the option of either finding employment or applying to continue into the two-year Master of Architecture program, which will allow students to become professional architects. The Master of Architecture is a 200 point professional degree that emphasises the central role of design in the studio.
