    "overview": [
        "Waste Management is offered as a major field of study in the Master of Environment degree.",
        "Waste is more than just what people throw in the bin. There are air-borne emissions, liquid wastes that impact on water supplies as well as the complex waste streams produced by industry that can have toxic impacts on the environment.",
        "Waste Management is concerned with the management of various waste streams. We study waste avoidance and minimisation, best environmental practice and provide the tools for sound decision making at the design and implementation phases of waste management projects.",
        "By studying Waste Management, you'll develop theoretical and practical skills for working in environmental control authorities, industry and elsewhere. If you are a student with an undergraduate degree in another discipline, gain investigative and management skills as part of an engineering education.",
        "You can expect to find employment in environmental control authorities, urban and industrial workplaces, local government, education, or as a consultant."
