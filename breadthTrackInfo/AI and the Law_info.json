        "Overview": [
            "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is predicted to play an increasingly integral role in almost all aspects of our lives, including in fields of policing, public administration, environmental protection, education, medicine, finance and law. This track provides students with the skills necessary to deal with the technical, ethical and legal challenges that arise in designing, governing and regulating AI that is fair, safe and beneficial to society. This specialist track builds on the work of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Ethics (CAIDE), a cross disciplinary research centre at the University of Melbourne bringing together academics researching all aspects of AI ethics and regulation, including from engineering, computer science, humanities, science and law."
