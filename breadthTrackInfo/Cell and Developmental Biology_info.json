        "Overview": [
            "This track will develop a student's general interest in biology and focus particularly on how cells function, particularly in the context of multicellular organisms. With emphasis on current research methodologies, it provides insights into how cells 'translate' the genetic code to produce and transport proteins to specific sites within or outside the cell to control processes required for cell survival, proliferation, movement and growth and how these processes controlled and orchestrated during the remarkable progression of a fertilised egg into an independent organism."

        "What is a Breadth Track?": [
            "A breadth track is a sequence of three or more subjects (taken as part of a Melbourne Bachelor degree) that progressively develops knowledge and skills relevant to a coherent domain, theme, topic or issue. It is a suggested set of subjects, rather than a requirement."
