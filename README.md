Upgrading student handbook

This branch contains code to test the responses of the Chatbot based on their similarity to scraped data.
Simply run testing.ipynb to select random subjects, majors, and courses and compare Chatbot responses to test questions with actual data.

Questions tested: 
Subjects
- “Who is the subject coordinator of [subject]”?
- “What assessments does [subject] have?”
- “What is [subject]?”
- “When does [subject] run?”

Courses
- “What is [course]?”
- “What majors are available in[course]?” - Also difficult due to some courses not containing majors

Majors
- “What is [major]?”
- “What subjects do I need to complete [major]?”
