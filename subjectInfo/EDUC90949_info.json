        "This subject provides students with the opportunity for a practical engagement with education policy issues through a placement in an approved organisation or through structured visits to a number of approved educational organisations. There is the potential to select pre-negotiated options or for students to develop an individualised program subject to the approval of the course coordinator. Students will examine education policy and policy reform issues in the context of policy development, implementation and/or evaluation. They will draw on the research literature to examine the key policy issues and debates relevant to their placement or series of visits."
