        "This subject involves students undertaking a small-scale research project in school settings or studio teaching or in an area of relevance to their work as music educators. This subject will build on the research proposal developed in the prerequisite subject MUSI90150 Music Learning, Teaching and Research and involve students in undertaking a review of relevant scholarly literature and then implementing the research by collecting, analysing and interpreting of data.",
        "Typically the research project would involve students in a small action research study, case study, evaluation study or survey study. The research project will be presented for assessment as a report of approximately 10,000-12,000 words.",
        "This subject is the first part of a two-subject sequence, taught over two consecutive study periods. Students are required to enrol in MUSI90197 Professional Research Project Part 1 (12.5 points) and MUSI90198 Professional Research Project Part 2 (12.5 points), consecutively, for a total enrolment of 25 points.",
        "Students will receive a 'CNT' grade for Part 1. An overall result for the subject is given following completion of the two-subject sequence.",
        "Assessment, Subject Intended Learning Outcomes, and Total Time Commitment applies to the entire enrolments across Parts 1 and 2 of the subject.",
