    "overview": [
        "This subject examines the normal physiological function of body systems and students are introduced to pathophysiology through discussion of the processes of degeneration, disease and injury across the lifespan. The characteristics and behaviour of micro-organisms and their relationship to infectious diseases and the immune response will also be explored. Selected drugs and their actions within the body will be introduced to students."

    "indicative content": [],
    "intended learning outcomes": [
        "describe in detail the normal structure and function of the cells, tissues and organs constituting nervous system, special senses, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, musculoskeletal, genitourinary and reproductive systems;",
        "discuss how changes at cellular level affect the function of tissues, organs and body systems and precipitate physiological responses to maintain homeostasis",
        "identify the key structural and functional changes to major body systems at different stages of the human lifespan;",
        "discuss the role of the inflammatory process in maintenance of body homeostasis during tissue injury, infection and infectious disease;",
        "discuss the relationship between infection, altered immunity and disease;",
        "discuss the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and drug classification of select oral, topical and inhaled medications",
        "apply core physiological concepts to understand nursing assessment data and development of care plans",
        "identify key issues surrounding health of vulnerable populations such as paediatric, Indigenous peoples and mental health consumers",
        "understand that conveying complex information on clinical anatomy, physiology, microbiology, immunology and pharmacology must respect Indigenous ethical concerns, involve consultation with Indigenous peoples and reflect indigenous experience",
        "increase student's awareness of providing culturally sensitive and culturally competent education services to Indigenous peoples",
        "interpret physiological data in the context of normal physiology to identify implications for monitoring health status and link that to evidence-based nursing interventions"
