    "overview": [
        "Landscape grading and its representation has an intense and rich history. Within this subject we explore the relationship between digital modelling, geological processes and design with landform. We will be investigating and testing methods for representing conceptual, structural, aesthetic and engineering design decisions.",
        "The subject is structured in two parts: The first part develops skills in traditional hand drawn landscape design tools while the second part develops skills in evolving software to represent complex intersections between the landform of existing sites and proposals for built form.",
        "The importance of landform modelling to the design vocabulary of landscape architecture will be introduced, alongside fundamental principles of drainage, levels, surveying and representation techniques.",
