        "This subject is the capstone project for the Informatics major and the Computing and Software Systems major in the BSc. Students will work on a real life problem in a small team, supervised by a member of staff. Each team will analyse the information needs of users and develop working computational solutions. Students are expected to apply sound principles studied over the course of their degree to the formulation and solution of their problem.",

A key part of the project is for students to develop and manage a project in order to deliver a quality IT product. Workshops will explore the application of theory to the project and include selected topics drawn from: ethics, project management, design frameworks, testing, technical reviews, and product evaluation."

            "Tutors in the subject act as mentors and guide teams throughout the project. The interaction between the student team and the tutors often raise issues that provide the topics for workshops.",
            "The subject comprises one lecture and one two-hour workshop per week. Lectures are used to coordinate the teams, deliver theory and practice relevant to the stage of the project reached, and to share experiences between the teams. Workshops are used to discuss issues raised within the project, translate theory to practice relevant to the stage of the project reached, to provide hands-on practice with tools, and to share experiences.",
            "INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCES",
            "The subject is administered through the Universities Learning Management System (LMS). Templates for the various artefacts, guidelines on IT processes and links to tools are available through LMS. A standard development environment is available which includes programming languages, libraries and development tools and is on most engineering computers",
            "CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKS",
            "The IT industry is expanding and along with it the demand for IT professionals that are capable of the analytical and management skills beyond programming. The industry is also changing in the nature of the projects being undertaken with many IT professionals working in multidisciplinary project teams. The skills and experience gained in this subject are valued by employers and are often seen as a necessary grounding for a career in IT-related industries.",
            "The subject aims to source product ideas from clients outside of the Department where possible and thus seeks to expose students to the types of environments in which software development take place. Guest lectures by are also given to highlight aspects of industrial practice and to expose students to current practice."
