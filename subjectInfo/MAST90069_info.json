        "The first half of this subject is an introduction to two-dimensional conformal field theory with emphasis on the operator formalism and explicit calculations. The second half is an introduction to string theory based on the first half. For concreteness, the representation theory of Virasoro algebra and bosonic strings will be emphasized."
