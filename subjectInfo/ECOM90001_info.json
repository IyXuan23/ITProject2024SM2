        "This subject examines multiple regression analysis and its use in economics, management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Topics will include the properties of estimators, hypothesis testing, specification error, multicollinearity, dummy variables, heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, panel data, and methods for discrete dependent variables. These methods are consolidated through a research project which involves formulating hypotheses, real-world data collection, and writing-up the results in a formal report."
