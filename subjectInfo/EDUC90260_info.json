        "In this subject, students will further develop their understanding of the theoretical and practical ideas underpinning the Primary Years Programme (PYP) gained from the previous core subjects and its application in different settings. Students will critically explore definitions of international-mindedness, inquiry based learning and the learner profile. They will examine transdisciplinary themes and the relationships between concept-driven curriculum, skills, knowledge, attitudes and action and how the standards and practices of the PYP can be applied in different ways."
