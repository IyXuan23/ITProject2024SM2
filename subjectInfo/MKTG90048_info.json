    "overview": [
        "Business markets account for approximately two-thirds of all economic activities and for the vast majority of jobs. Nevertheless, typical B2B firms remain largely unknown to the public, yet they are leaders in their respective areas. This subject aims to provide insight into the issues, and challenges of particular interest to firms operating in business markets. Skilled B2B marketing professionals tend to make more strategic decisions based on long term profits and stakeholder benefits. Thus, to operate successfully, skills in procurement, sales, negotiations, crafting value propositions (value-in-use) as well as aspects of contractual and relational governance need to be put into placed. Students will learn about business relationship dynamics, their development and decay, and their embeddedness to business networks.",
        "Furthermore, it is the objective of this subject to link theory and practice through different cases. Cases help to develop an ability to effectively use and apply concepts in real-life organizations. As such, the aim is to provide an experience that also includes the use of industry executives."
