        "This subject will introduce students to the unique possibilities inherent in printmaking processes, with a technical focus on monotype and relief techniques.",
        "Alongside this workshop focus, students will be introduced to the key historical moments in the evolution of printmaking through an introductory lecture, which encompasses the fundamental technological innovations that have impacted upon printmaking, as well as the major terms of reference that will allow students to engage with printmaking terminology within a workshop environment.",
        "Within the workshop, students will be encouraged to explore their own work and utilise a selection of techniques by engaging with ideas of repetition, difference, and variation.",
        "This subject is designed to explore printmaking processes and technology as a vehicle for imaging ideas and image production, as well as to motivate and involve students in analytical thinking about visual perception. It also includes an induction into the Printmaking workshop, with an emphasis on Occupational Health & Safety."
