        "This subject will teach students the fundamental links between climate, climate change and human health. Students will be exposed to the global frameworks underpinning climate change and human health, including widely used decision-support tools such as Vulnerability and Capacity Assessments. Themes will include justice, co-design of solutions and how human health links in with Climate Resilient Development (CRD). The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment will form a core basis for the subject, along with WHO guidance materials and panel discussions with policymakers, practitioners and researchers."
