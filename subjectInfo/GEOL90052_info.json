    "overview": [
        "This subject comprises two intensive modules - Module 1: Geology of Gold and Module 2: Igneous Dynamics and Magmatic Ore Deposits.",
        "Module 1 provides a broad coverage of gold geology and exploration, as well as some of the latest research ideas and how they apply to mineral exploration. The module covers all major types of gold deposits with emphasis on Archaean deposits of Western Australia and slate-belt deposits of the Victorian gold province.",
        "Module 2 provides an overview of the geology of major Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulphide deposits, PGE deposits, and diamond deposits with an emphasis on the processes controlling their genesis and how this information can be applied in exploration. The module will also introduce some of the theoretical concepts involved in ore formation such as the factors controlling sulphur solubility in mafic magmas and the roles of partial melting and crustal contamination in the genesis of Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulphide deposits.",
        "In both modules, the core sub-discipline areas of geochemistry, structural geology, regolith and deposit geology are covered at a level to enable participants to take their place in industry and government teams and make a contribution in all of these areas. The combined modules focus on a holistic approach that uses all applicable fields of geology to address issues pertaining to precious metal and magmatic ore deposits.",
        "This subject is delivered intensively between weeks 2 and 6 of Semester 1."
