        "The oceans cover 71% of the earth\u2019s surface and support an incredible diversity of life. This subject provides a comprehensive and contemporary overview of the biodiversity and biogeography of marine animals, plants and micro-organisms. It then explores the role that ecology and evolution play in shaping patterns of abundance, demography, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning in the marine realm."
