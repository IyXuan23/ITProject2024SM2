    "overview": [
        "Environment/Behaviour Methods for Design examines a range of research methods and methodologies that designers can use to inform their design thinking. This subject is geared to planning and design students who want to learn E/B research field methods and their application for use in their studies (e.g. site analysis, thesis research) and later professional work. Students studying landscape architecture, urban design and planning will benefit from the tool box of evidence-based environment behaviour (EB) methods covered in this subject in which they learn how to use the various methods to study how people, and groups of people, use, perceive and think about built urban spaces to inform their design and planning decision-making. Methods covered in this subject are primary those derived from environmental psychological, which have been developed over many years for addressing a range of environment behaviour research questions. Students will develop a working knowledge of these various research methods and their applications, with a focus on urban environments and their users\u2019 needs and preferences. The subject encompasses lectures, case studies, readings and individual projects and includes, but is not limited to, exploring methods for behavioural mapping and systematic observation of spaces, measuring responses to visual stimuli, user surveys and interviews and a wide range of other useful methods, both qualitative and quantitively, that can be used to explore human/environment interactions within the context of real-world urban environments. Methods for collection and analysis of data, representing the findings and their translation into design decision-making are also covered."
