    "overview": [
        "This subject was formerly known as Concrete Structures and Construction",
        "Commercial and high rise construction (excluding industrial buildings) relies heavily on the use of reinforced concrete for structural components. The cost of the building structure is a significant portion of the total cost of the project. Interpretations of the information provided by the engineers\u2019 reinforced concrete drawings and specifications provides the necessary means to be able to transfer this data into the physical built form. As a result, this subject investigates the rheology of concrete and the use of admixtures. Structural design concepts for reinforced concrete structures are analysed and their influence on construction methods assessed. The concepts relate to reinforced concrete frames including slab and beam systems, prestressed concrete design concepts and construction methods and composite construction systems. Other related topics include exposed concrete surface finishes, sprayed concrete technology, concrete detailing and constructability.",
        "Incidental costs",
        "Students will be required to purchase personal protective equipment (steel-toed boots, hard-hat, hi-vis vest and safety goggles); cost approx. $80 to $120 per person. Students may use equipment from a previous subject if these are in good working condition"

        "Identify factors affecting the choice of structural flooring for reinforced and steel-concrete composite structures;",
        "Understand the effects of prestress on the behaviour of concrete beams and slabs",
        "Propose and evaluate alternative structural systems",
        "Develop an ability to link structural design concepts and relate these to current construction practices",
        "Communicate construction design solution using sketches and drawings",
        "Develop an ability to interpret structural drawings and be conversant with engineering terminology"
