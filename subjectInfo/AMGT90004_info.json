        "This subject introduces students to theoretical perspectives on arts and cultural policy and explains how various historical, political, and cultural contexts shape cultural policies in different nation states. The subject provides a broad overview of multiple aspects of cultural policies including regulating public arts, preserving national cultural heritage, contributing to sustainable economic, environmental, and urban development, as well as protecting cultural diversity on local and global levels. The subject explains how different political and cultural actors are involved in complex processes of creating, communicating, restructuring, or resisting cultural policies and how they affect local economies, reframe social and cultural composition of communities, as well as contribute to place branding.",
