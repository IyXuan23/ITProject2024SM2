        "Commercial Aspects of International Law highlights the growing importance of public international law for transnational commercial activity. It will examine how public international law may apply and have practical use in a wide variety of international business matters.",
        "The subject will introduce students to the basics of relevant public international law principles (e.g. sources of international law, individuals as subjects of international law, state responsibility for wrongful acts and sovereign immunity). Thereafter, the majority of our subject will be devoted to topic areas in which public international law impacts commercial rights and obligations (e.g. the role of international law in contracts, double tax treaties, environment and climate change regulation, free trade agreements, investment protection treaties, UN sanctions, corporate social responsibility and business and human rights).  Our classes will take the perspective of the rights and obligations of commercial enterprises under public international law."
