    "overview": [
        "This subject will build advanced skills in designing and conducting qualitative health research, further developing students\u2019 basic knowledge of qualitative research methods. This includes the development of advanced skills in data collection and analytic methods, strategies to respond to the challenges and complexity associated with qualitative research in the field. Students will have the opportunity to workshop and practice these skills during the intensive teaching period. Students will also develop a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical perspectives used in qualitative research. The subject will also cover ethics in qualitative research in depth, preparing students to both submit an ethics application and to deal with ethical challenges that arise in the field. The subject will cover all aspects of design, including consideration of issues related to rigour, quality and reflexivity in addition to the introduction of new and emerging methods of data collection. The subject will cover the practicalities of collecting data in another country or community and how to navigate the process of analysis and writing up, whether this is as part of a team, with the community or a solo endeavour. These skills will equip students to undertake qualitative health research in a range of practice contexts, including in health services, with patient groups, with communities, and in order to design and assess the impact of health interventions and policies."
