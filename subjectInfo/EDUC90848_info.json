        "This subject is designed to provide students with an overview of the methodologies for conducting research in evaluation. In particular, the subject provides students with an introduction to the philosophical backgrounds and influences on social research, epistemological and ontological considerations, and the basic foundations of research design, logic of inquiry, and ethics of social research. Students will work on developing research questions and operationalise them to enable data gathering, analysis and interpretation as well as evaluate existing social research."
