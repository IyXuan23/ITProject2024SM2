    "overview": [
        "Rapid technological advancements coupled with an ageing population will place the onus on health care workers to provide world class, human centric care that responds to the individual and their community in an empathetic manner. The wellbeing of our practitioners and health educators will be instrumental to our success in this evolving environment. Across this subject, students will learn about diverse contemporary issues that impact the audiology profession. Students will be supported to discuss and explore ethical practice in the context of these issues. Students learning will be scaffolded through the use of a reflective learning framework designed to encourage critical examination of topics as they apply to the profession and themselves as future practitioners. This framework will also allow for integration of clinical reasoning skills with professional practice expectations. Students will receive feedback on their developing communication skills throughout the subject, culminating in an assessment involving roleplay at the end of semester. At the completion of this subject, students will have an understanding of the professional values, attributes and competencies that will support their development as reflective life\u2010long learners who are responsive to the changing demands of the audiology profession."
