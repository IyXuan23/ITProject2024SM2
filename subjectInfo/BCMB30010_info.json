        "To participate in the rapidly expanding fields of genome research and protein structure-function analysis, it is necessary to have an understanding of the techniques used in these areas.",
        "This subject provides training in the use of molecular biology technologies of, protein analyses and cell biology. Students will learn how experiments are designed, performed and the resulting data analysed.",
        "Experiments in the subject will explore (a) the use of recombinant DNA analyses, (b) bacterial expression systems to produce and characterise recombinant protein, (c) identification of proteins by mass spectrometry; and (d) mammalian cell culture.",
        "Students will learn practical skills of how to record data and maintain experimental observations in laboratory notebooks, to search bioinformatic databases, and to construct and concisely write a scientific research paper based on their findings.  Students will also further develop their skills in performing biochemical calculations and solving problems by applying knowledge attained from practicals."
