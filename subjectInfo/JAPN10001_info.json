        "This subject is designed for students with no Japanese learning background. Students will develop essential foundation of Japanese literacy in order to be able to engage in social events and situations in an appropriate manner, while drawing on their background knowledge in their first language. Students will be introduced to the two sets of Japanese syllabaries (hiragana and katakana) and around 60 kanji characters. Students will develop communication skills required to deal with initial social encounters (self-introduction and greetings), exchanging information on everyday life routines and surroundings, and activities in which they are likely to engage in establishing a new life in a foreign country (e.g. shopping, finding ways). Students will also develop skills to enable them to get by in everyday life in Japan. In addition, students will develop intercultural understanding through identification of common Japanese rituals and routines, reflecting on their own culture and comparing between them."
