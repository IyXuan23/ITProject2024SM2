        "This subject covers topics such as exile and immigration in France, immigration policies and their direct impact on the migrant population, colonisation and decolonisation, racism and multiculturalism, French identity, nationality and citizenship. On completion of this subject, students should be able to analyse critically and synthesise coherently the arguments in the debate on immigration in France, discriminate among statements of evidence, interpretation, opinion and facts, regarding the definition and redefinition of the notions of culture, identity, and Frenchness in the context of globalisation, and compare and reflect on similar issues of immigration in other countries, in particular Australia. This subject is taught and assessed in French."
