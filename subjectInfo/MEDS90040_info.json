        "This subject provides a range of Discovery choices for students entering their second year of medical studies.Whereas the previous subject \u201cMD Discovery 1: Foundation\u201d was intended to lay a basic grounding in the area of interest, \u201cMD Discovery 2: Application\u201d gives students the opportunity to discover new areas of learning and apply them to the clinical practice environment in which they are now immersed.Where available, students may choose to build on a foundation of knowledge established in the subject \u201cMD Discovery 1: Foundation\u201d in the first year of their Doctor of Medicine course, or they can choose to explore completely different topics of interest.Each of the learning options available within this subject meets the educational standards required of the rest of the medical degree and is designed to enhance the student\u2019s personal and professional growth. Students are encouraged to choose options that broaden and deepen their learning. The Learning Advisors will ensure that any option or combination will meet the subject learning outcomes and the required level of assessment.",

Or, it can provide a stand-alone learning experience."
