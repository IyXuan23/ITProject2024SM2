        "Wildlife Management has varied goals, addressing issues as diverse as conservation and biodiversity, human-animal conflict, pest animal control, overabundance and potential for disease spill over.",
        "This subject will expose students to real-life examples of wildlife management in Australia, and provide them with opportunities to meet and interact with relevant professionals in this field during synchronous online teaching sessions. Although examples in this subject are based in Australia, the principles students engage with are applicable across the globe. All synchronous teaching activities will also be recorded, and thus available asynchronously.",
        "Staff from a variety of government and not-for-profit agencies involved in wildlife management will present an outline of their management programs and provide detailed information about specific management issues and activities. Further materials to support the themes discussed, and to provide students with additional background and context for each management example, will be provided through asynchronous delivery."
