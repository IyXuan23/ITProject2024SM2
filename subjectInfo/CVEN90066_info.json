    "overview": [
        "The subject examines in-depth the observation, analysis and prediction of wind-generated waves in the open ocean, in shelf seas, and in coastal regions. It also provides an introduction to wave and hydrodynamics modelling as a support for engineering applications. It provides a multi-disciplinary overview of problems by combining cutting-edge research in Maritime and Coastal Engineering and industry applications. The subject will provide students with a solid grounding in wave physics that is essential to evaluate the environmental impact on design and operation of marine structures.",
