    "overview": [
        "This subject provides an introduction to quantum computing for students from a range of backgrounds that will position students for further studies in quantum computing and programming. The syllabus will cover basic principles of quantum bits (qubits) and quantum logic operations, through to applications in communication, security, optimisation, finance and machine learning. In computer-based tutorials, students will learn quantum computer programming using a state-of-the-art simulation environment, and access online quantum computer systems where available. This subject will be taught by a multi-disciplinary teaching team from physics, mathematics, computer science and finance."
