        "In this subject each student is required to define and explore a specific area or activity in their chosen practice that underpins their work as artists and researchers. Through the development and execution of a defined major project the student is encouraged to explore the critical landscape surrounding their practice and the artistic possibilities of their own place within it.",
        "Whether through the writing and directing of a short film, an exploration of game lore, the drafting of a feature film script or the pursuit of any other crucial aspect of contemporary screen practice (editing, sound, cinematography, animation), this subject offers the student an opportunity to create a major work that tests and progresses their creative and critical capacity as a practitioner.",
        "This subject aims to challenge and extend students' understanding of screen practice and develop considerate, open, courageous, thinking artists.",
        "Travel",
        "Depending on the nature of the discipline and project, students may travel to undertake fieldwork where this aligns to the outcomes of their major project. Any travel undertaken is at the student's own expense."
