    "overview": [
        "Merger & acquisition activity is a mainstay of the growth characteristics of large firms. It has been a feature of business life for well over a century. Whilst there have been many merger \u2019waves\u2019 over the years, this pathway to growth has constantly maintained its importance. This subject begins with an examination of the history of, and reasons for, merger and acquisition activity thereby providing a rationale for the study of the whole of the merger & acquisition process. This process extends from the decision to acquire through to the means of achieving successful post-merger integration.",
        "The subject will concentrate on the four fundamental elements of M&A:",
        "Undertaking deals for the right reasons \u2013 strategy",
        "Ensuring the right price is paid \u2013 valuation",
        "Finding the right information on which to make the decision \u2013 due diligence",
        "Making the deal work after completion \u2013 post-merger integration",
        "Studying these and other elements of M&A will utilise all the skills you have developed in the core subjects of your MBA."
