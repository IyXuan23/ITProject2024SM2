        "This subject will introduce students to quantitative methods with applications in social science research. Topics covered will include: describing, summarising and visualising data; observational and experimental methods, and; statistical inference and the general linear model including its assumptions. This subject will discuss causal inference in relation to study design. Practical work will involve using statistical software to apply the methods covered to a pre-existing survey dataset."
