        "This subject is aimed at introducing the fundamentals of sustainability practices, frameworks and standards in end to end supply chains. The foundation of this subject is based on four pillars that start from an introduction to sustainability-related performance measures in supply chains. The subject then moves on into discussing frameworks for identifying, assessing and managing sustainability-related supply chain risks. The major sustainability standards for businesses and their supply chains are introduced and discussed. Furthermore, the nature of closed loop supply chains and circular economies to achieve sustainable operations in supply chains are examined and debated."
