    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed to encourage students to continue to think about how and why animals play such an important role in our society. Nearly two third of Australian households contain a pet, and these pets are often considered part of the family.",
        "Animals in Society 2 covers the different roles of animals in our society and the special bond between humans and animals, including the history and ethical consideration. This unique bond between humans and animals provides many benefits to both, but also comes at a cost. Utilising case studies of current hot topics in animal welfare we examine human-animal relationships and emphasize the complex roles and responsibilities, and ethical requirements in human contact with animals.",
        "The subject includes regular guest lectures by people prominent in the field, recognised experts, and/or have an interesting perspective to share. There are four themes within the subject: The Human-Animal Bond; Zoos and wild animals in captivity; Animals in sport and entertainment; and Controversial Human-Animal interactions."
