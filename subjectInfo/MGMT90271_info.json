        "Front-line leaders play a critical role at the interface between organisational systems and policies designed to drive efficiency and performance management teams, such as lean and agile, and the task of implementing them.  This challenge requires an understanding of both the technical and human dimension required to effectively manage resources and systems, including the challenge of leading individuals and teams through organisational change required to maintain and improve performance.  This subject brings together an understanding of this task as both a technical and a human problem in contemporary workplaces where disruptive events, technologies and business models require front-line managers to adapt and develop collective agility within teams to maintain performance and sustain competitive advantage. Topics considered will include core front line operations, such as sourcing strategies, resource management, technologies, and efficient operations management, and team leadership dimensions of high performance teams, including team structure and roles, team and individual performance management, team dynamics and leadership and addressing team and individual under-performance."
