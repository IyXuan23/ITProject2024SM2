    "overview": [
        "This subject examines the major intensive animal production systems in Australia and internationally, with a focus on the impact of management practices on the health and welfare of animal populations.  Through industry-based placements as well as case-based syndicate work relevant to the major intensive production systems (poultry, pigs, fish and laboratory animals), students will develop an appreciation of the major determinants of profitability, productivity and sustainability of these industries, be able to describe the basic principles of breeding, management, nutrition, animal welfare and disease control as they relate to intensive animal production systems, and be able to specify where veterinary input may be important. Students will gain an understanding of the ethical and legal frameworks that govern the major intensive livestock industries in Australia, assuring the safe, ethical and legal production of food products."
