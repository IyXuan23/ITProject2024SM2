If you are considering a specialisation please seek course advice from STOP 1 and/or your Course Coordinator before considering the Internship subject (ie. before applying for any internships). If you enrol in the internship subject, you may later find that you have used up 25 points of electives, preventing you from taking certain specialisations. For that reason it is important to course plan very carefully."
