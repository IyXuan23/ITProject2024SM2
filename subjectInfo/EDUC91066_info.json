    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the development of young children\u2019s early numeracy skills from Birth to 8 Years. The subject is informed by the Australian/Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks and Curricula: Mathematics, which will be referenced when planning, assessing, and implementing learning experiences. The importance of providing rich mathematical encounters with young children that connect to their lives will be emphasised throughout the subject. High quality early childhood education curriculum recognises the important role played by the home numeracy environment and provides opportunities for young children to engage with mathematical concepts and to acquire mathematical language.",
        "Teacher Candidates will analyse the development of key concepts in early numeracy and identify critical developmental stages for children\u2019s learning. Teacher Candidates will consider important pedagogical issues such as: language development, questioning, and mathematical representations. Teacher Candidates will engage in the Clinical Teaching Model to target learning experiences to the developmental needs of young children.",
