    "overview": [
        "Accounting Research Report 1is a year-long subject in the second year of the Master of Commerce (Accounting) Program designed to develop a student\u2019s research skills during their coursework training. The objective is to allow students to use what they have learned during the first year of coursework in the Master of Commerce (Accounting) Program and develop a research project based on a sound theoretical framework. The subject will also require students to collect data to test their theoretical framework and prepare a manuscript that can be workshopped and submitted for publication in a leading accounting research journal. The Director of the Doctoral Program in Accounting or their nominee must approve the topic and, in discussion with the student, assign a supervisor. A one\u2010page summary of the Research Proposal should be submitted to Director of the Doctoral Program and the Supervisor/s of the project. This is due by the end of January. This is not an assessment piece but rather for discussion with the Director of the Program, potential supervisor of the project and the student. The Research Report must be submitted by the end of the November University Examination Period."
