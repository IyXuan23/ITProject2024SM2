        "This subject aims to familiarise students with authentic literary Japanese texts. Students will read various forms and styles of reading materials including well-known Japanese novels and poems. Students will learn new vocabulary, phrases, and expressions. Students will also learn useful reading strategies. The study of Japanese culture-specific language use in various contexts and its historical background is explored. On completion of this subject, students should develop further understanding of cultural-specific language. Students who complete this subject are expected to have gained confidence to read other contemporary Japanese texts on their own. The medium of instruction is entirely Japanese."
