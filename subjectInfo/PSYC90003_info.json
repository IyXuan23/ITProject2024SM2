        "This subject is intended as part of a student's preparation for writing their postgraduate psychology thesis by ensuring that they have an extensive knowledge of the contemporary literature in that area along with an understanding of the methodology underlying relevant research. This review of the literature will enable them to determine a pertinent research question by identifying a gap in the literature.  Students will conduct their own research projects as outlined in PSYC90095 Thesis (Masters/coursework) Part 1 / PSYC90096 Thesis (Masters/coursework) Part 2."
