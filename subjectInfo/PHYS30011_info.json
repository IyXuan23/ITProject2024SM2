        "By the conclusion of this subject students will have explored the nexus between clinical condition and bench research. Students will be presented with a series of clinical cases or physiological challenges and will examine the underlying physiological dysregulation in each scenario. Working in teams, students will develop a set of questions about the clinical presentation, will draw on their collective existing knowledge of human physiology, examine the limits of existing contemporary research to formulate their own explanation of the underlying pathophysiology, and propose novel research approaches to better understand the mechanisms physiological regulation and dysregulation."

        "Evaluate cellular and molecular processes that underlie normal cell function and evaluate how dysregulation of these pathways lead to health complications",
        "Incorporate their understanding of normal physiology with contemporary research to formulate a working hypothesis for the mechanistic cause of disease states",
        "Communicate and defend their evidence-based diagnosis",
        "Develop their own research question on a disease state of their choice, investigate and critique the contemporary research in the field and design their own research proposal to better understand the underlying physiology of the clinical case"
