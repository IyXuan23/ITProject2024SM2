        "The aim of this subject is to provide students with grounding in mathematical and statistical modelling techniques that are of particular relevance to actuarial work, including methods of estimating mortality rates and assessing their adherence to data and smoothness, as well as techniques for mortality projections. Also, elementary principles of machine learning are covered, with applications to mortality modelling."
