    "overview": [
        "What is religion? What purpose does it serve? How does it vary across cultures? Can you have religion without god(s)? Why is it growing rapidly in many parts of the world despite predictions of its inevitable decline? Are new forms of faith emerging to replace the old forms? In this subject, we explore the symbolic systems and ritual practices that help us all make sense of our place in the social world, the political order, the environment, and the cosmos. Drawing on classic and contemporary anthropological approaches to religion, we ask new questions about the ancient and novel religious traditions that seem to be flourishing in the uncertain world of the early twenty-first century.",
        "The subject involves interactive lectures and small group discussions. Assessments offer students the chance to learn from and with peers; to practice the art of writing concise, engaging, research-based analysis aimed at a broad readership; and to undertake hands-on ethnographic observation of religious practice."
