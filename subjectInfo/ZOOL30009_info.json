    "overview": [
        "This is a largely field-based subject, based in one of several possible locations, though generally in the Daintree Rainforest in northern Queensland.  The subject provides a capstone research experience in which students undertake a field-based research project around a problem in ecology or evolution.  Students will design and execute the project, and will gain hands on experience in basic ecological field methods.  They will then analyse their data, and report on their results, in written and oral reporting styles",
        "Students should be aware that this course entails an additional cost associated with travel and accommodation; typically between $1500-$2000.",
        "Students who require this subject in order to complete a major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, but who are experiencing financial difficulty should contact the subject coordinator toenquireabout the possibility of scholarship support."

        "communicate research results in both oral and written form, making use of scientific literature to support and contextualise;",
        "articulate the value that ecological and evolutionary research brings to our basic understanding as well as to the issues faced by human societies; and",
        "articulate the deep cultural and biogeographic history that shapes Australian landscapes."
