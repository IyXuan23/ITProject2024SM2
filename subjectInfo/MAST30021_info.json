    "overview": [
        "Complex analysis is a core subject in pure and applied mathematics, as well as the physical and engineering sciences. While it is true that physical phenomena are given in terms of real numbers and real variables, it is often too difficult and sometimes not possible, to solve the algebraic and differential equations used to model these phenomena without introducing complex numbers and complex variables and applying the powerful techniques of complex analysis.",
        "Topics include:the topology of the complex plane; convergence of complex sequences and series; holomorphic functions, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, harmonic functions and applications; contour integrals and the Cauchy Integral Theorem; singularities, Laurent series, the Residue Theorem, evaluation of integrals using contour integration, conformal mapping; and aspects of the gamma function."
