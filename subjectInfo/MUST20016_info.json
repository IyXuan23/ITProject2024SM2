    "overview": [
        "This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.",
        "This subject demystifies one of the most popular cultural phenomena of our time: the musical. From the quintessential book musical Oklahoma to the ground-breaking, international sensation Hamilton, students will uncover how and why some of the most well-known and loved musicals were created, to understand how musicals can reflect our society in ways that are poignant, powerful, artistically brilliant and even - at times - problematic.In this fully online subject, students will view an in-depth and fascinating video lecture series, undertake practical exploration through instructional singing videos and have this experience enhanced through workshop-style online tutorials. Throughout the course students will be introduced to new perspectives and ways of listening to and interpreting musical theatre. In exploring their voices in a safe and supportive environment, students will learn basic music theory, basic vocal anatomy and learn to sing a selection of artistically and socially significant musical theatre works from the 20th and 21st centuries.",
        "Along with fortnightly tests, a creative written assignment will give students the opportunity to undertake independent research and draw on their embodied knowledge of singing musical theatre repertoire to critically assess how musicals can be a powerful vehicle for change in our society. Students will also submit practical singing assessments individually, with the final submission culminating in the creation of a \u2018Zoom Choir\u2019 performance. In this subject, theory and practice will be combined to deepen students\u2019 understanding of musical theatre and its relevance in today\u2019s society. No prior singing or music experience is necessary."
