    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces Teacher Candidates to the theory and practice of teaching TESOL in the context of Australian/Victorian Curricula and Frameworks. This subject provides Teacher Candidates with both the knowledge base and skills of professional practice, enabling them to effectively educate all secondary school students (Years 7-12) in this specific learning area, and to work effectively within school contexts.",
        "Teacher Candidates are supported to develop knowledge and skills related to curriculum content, best practice pedagogy and assessment, as well as the application and management of these activities in classrooms. Framed through the Clinical Teaching Model, they are supported to adapt and apply this knowledge in lesson planning, including the selection and integration of teaching strategies and resources, including the effective and appropriate use of ICT, to meet the specific needs of students from diverse backgrounds, and to engage students in their learning.",
        "The assessment tasks in this subject will support the development of Teacher Candidates\u2019 understanding of contemporary theories and pedagogies of the TESOL field and their relationship with content and pedagogical knowledge, along with specific skills in developing, sequencing, and delivering programs."
