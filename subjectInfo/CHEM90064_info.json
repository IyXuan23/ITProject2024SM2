    "overview": [
        "This subject explores the major historical developments of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the role of analytical chemistry in environmental monitoring, assessment and regulation. This subject provides an overview of trace level pollutant measurement using isotope surrogate dilution with measurement performed on LCMS and GCMS instrumental techniques. Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants and per and poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) will be used as case studies to explain the relationship between chemical properties with analytical measurements as well as environmental fate, behaviour and ecological impact."
