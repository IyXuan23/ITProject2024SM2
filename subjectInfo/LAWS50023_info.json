    "overview": [
        "In this foundational subject, students will develop a critical understanding of the core elements of legal method and reasoning in Australia's common law legal system. Students in Legal Method and Reasoning will analyse the principal sources of law and the functions they perform in modern Australian society. The relationship between sources of law will be explored as will contemporary debates on common law method and the ways in which different sources of law have evolved.",
        "Methodological issues will be considered in substantive contexts which give students an opportunity to develop an understanding of the social role of law. Throughout this intensively taught subject, students will have an opportunity to critically interrogate whether or not these sources of law, the institutions from which they are derived and the methodologies employed to develop binding rules and principles of law are in need of reform.",
        "Students will be taught in interactive, discussion-oriented classes. Assessment tasks will be designed to give students detailed, formative feedback on the skills they have acquired in the subject.",
        "Legal Method and Reasoning's emphasis is on the contemporary application of the rules and principles governing how the common law and statutory law operate. Given its foundational subject matter, this subject will prepare students for the compulsory subjects they undertake in their first full semester of studies.",
        "The principal topics which are canvassed include:",
        "Analysis of case law, with a focus on complex scenarios using common law reasoning;",
        "critical exploration of the concept and use of precedent;",
        "examination of the emergence of new principles;",
        "analysis of statutes, in practical, contemporary settings;",
        "critical exploration of statutory interpretation, with an emphasis on the use of interpretation legislation, the purposive approach and extrinsic materials;",
        "the relationship between statutes and case-law and between different statutes; and",
        "presumptions in statutory interpretation, including the principle of legality."
