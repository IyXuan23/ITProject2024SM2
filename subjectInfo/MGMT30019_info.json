        "The way we work is changing. The forces of globalisation, technological advancement and population pressures are reshaping the nature and meaning of \u2018work\u2019. Graduates entering the new world of work face a revolution in working practices and organisational culture. There are greater opportunities for autonomy, flexibility and creativity, but there is also more uncertainty about job security and employment pathways. New work opportunities have emerged that did not exist just a few years ago, yet career choices that were previously considered \u2018safe\u2019 have also come under new threats from increasingly capable technologies.Addressing opportunities and challenges, this subject intends to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to meet, and eventually lead, the \u2018future of work\u2019.",
        "The subject is intended as a meaningful development journey that helps students to plan for and succeed in their careers. Through the use of reflection, peer interaction, case studies and workshops, students will learn how to apply the course content at the individual, organisational and global levels."
