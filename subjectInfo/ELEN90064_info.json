    "aims": [
        "This subject provides an introduction to modern control theory with a particular focus on design of advanced control laws via state-space methods and optimal control. The role of feedback in control design will be reinforced within this context, alongside the role of optimisation techniques in control system synthesis.INDICATIVE CONTENT",
        "Topics include:State-space models - first-order vector differential/difference equations; Lyapunov stability; linearisation; discretisation; Kalman decomposition (observable, detectable, reachable and stabilisable subspaces); state-feedback and pole placement; output-feedback and observer design in both continuous-time and discrete-time.Optimal control - dynamic programming; linear quadratic regulation in both continuous-time and discrete-time. Model predictive control in discrete-time; moving-horizon with constraints."
