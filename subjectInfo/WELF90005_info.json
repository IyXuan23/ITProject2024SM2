Issues of strong emotions and increasing and decreasing emotional intensity in a session will be explored. Psychosocial issues and how these impact on the counselling session will also be explored. Counselling skills learnt in Principles of Counselling 1 will be further developed through role-plays and discussion of presented case scenarios. On completion students will demonstrate self-awareness and the ability to critically appraise their counselling practice."
