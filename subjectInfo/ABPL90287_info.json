    "overview": [
        "This subject articulates and tests the idea of architectural design as a process where cultural and technological decision-making are intertwined. Teaching and learning activities focus on analysing technological means associated with design concepts and evaluating the implementation of alternatives in performance-based design scenarios.",
        "Using examples of past to present architectures, this subject shows and tries to assess design propositions through their technological implementation and vice versa. Topics and practical activities are focused on single-dwelling residential and small to medium scale commercial building typologies.",

        "Conduct project-based and industry-relevant research on building materials, systems,  components, and implement such research in the development of a coherent design proposition;",
        "Demonstrate proficiency in interpreting and communicating with methods of technical representation as used by the architecture, engineering, and construction industries."

Tutorials include assessed activities related to the content of the lectures and assignments, peer-to-peer feedback, one verbal group presentation with a guest, and weekly group and individual feedback on the work in progress. One 30-minute online video introduces students to basic drawing conventions, standards, and communication strategies. A virtual site visit introduces students to the construction stages of a typical Australian residential project. Learning resources are provided weekly on Canvas."
