    "overview": [
        "Computers are invaluable tools for modelling and simulating complex systems in a range of real word domains. The complex behaviours exhibited by many biological, social and technological systems - such as epidemics, urban systems and robotics - challenge our ability to predict, analyse and design such systems. Building computational models of these systems can help us better understand their structure and behaviour, and make better decisions about their design and control.",
        "The aim of this subject is to provide students with a solid foundation in the conceptual and technical skills required to design, implement and evaluate computational models of complex systems."
