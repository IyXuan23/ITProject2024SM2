        "This skills-led course is taught in computer labs. Students will learn how to collect website and social media data using both screen-scraping techniques and through APIs (Application Program Interfaces). The course is designed for non-programmers; no coding skills will be required. Once collected, students will learn how to clean and then analyse the data using two methods: content analysis and social network analysis. Finally, the course will introduce students to data visualisation techniques."
