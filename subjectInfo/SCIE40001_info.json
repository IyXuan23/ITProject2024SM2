    "overview": [
        "This subject will provide students with an opportunity to develop some critical thinking skills that are required for a variety of research activities. These skills will be gained from discussions, and critical evaluations, of some recently published research papers. In their written submissions, students will be required to write succinctly and accurately, while at the same time demonstrate their critical thinking in the set tasks. Attendance at regular research seminars delivered within the Faculty is recommended. Some discussion of the Faculties\u2019 research programs which are relevant to the student\u2019s research project will be expected."
