        "Understanding of social process and action is critical to effective land and environment management and social research skills are therefore valued by resource management agencies. This subject aims to equip students with knowledge and skills to design social research, which can be used to improve management of environments, agricultural and food systems. The subject presents a framework for understanding diverse approaches to social research; the relationship between theory and method is given particular emphasis.",
