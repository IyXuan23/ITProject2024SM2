        "This is a studio-based elective subject that enables students to develop an advanced planting design methodology. Plant characteristics are examined as a material for their uses and effects as an integral component of landscape architecture design. A site-specific design response is formed by addressing environmental, social, cultural and ecological criteria. Strategic approaches are explored through a series of lectures, practice-based case studies, and workshops. A field trip and site visits are included to promote critical reflection and evaluation of planting in built and natural landscapes. Design exercises are staged to develop a whole life-cycle approach to the planting design process, included:  collection and exchange of information; development of a plant selection matrix; generation and testing of concepts; production of a detail design proposition; and, devising feedbacking mechanisms. The subject aims to provide students with skills and appreciation for ongoing learning and working with plants as a lively, evolving material in landscape architecture design practice.",
