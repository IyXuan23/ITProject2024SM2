    "overview": [
        "Animals are faced with innumerable challenges across their lifetime that must be overcome if individuals are to survive and reproduce, and ultimately for species to persist. Many of these challenges, such as how to move, how to respire, how to sense your environment, how to feed, and how to reproduce, are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom, but have been solved in unique ways by different phyla.",
        "Animal Structure and Function is a lecture and laboratory-based subject that explores the amazing morphological diversity of life and how this has evolved to meet essential biological functions. The course is structured around a series of key \u2018biological challenges\u2019 within which we will compare and contrast different \u2018biological solutions\u2019 to the same problem across animals ranging from corals through to apes. In the practicals, you will learn how to classify animals and interpret their features, and develop an integrated understanding of animal diversity and the evolutionary forces that drive this."
