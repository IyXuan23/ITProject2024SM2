    "overview": [
        "This subject consolidates and builds upon the basic skills and knowledge acquired in German 1. It continues to provide a firm grounding in the fundamentals of German grammar, the tense system and language structure in conjunction with the development of cultural literacy. The curriculum explores the regional cultural and linguistic diversity of the German-speaking world. The overarching theme for German 2 is Berlin, past and present. Students engage with more complex grammatical and syntactic structures through more sophisticated texts drawn from a variety of sources \u2013 such as biographical, journalistic, popular media and literary texts \u2013 and expand their appreciation of texts in context. Emphasis is placed on increasing oral proficiency, enhancing communicative skills and the ability to initiate and sustain conversation in a greater range of informal and formal settings. Writing tasks will expand to short narratives, i.e. picture descriptions and biographies, and guided creative writing."
