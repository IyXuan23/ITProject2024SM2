    "overview": [
        "Following on from Orthodontics 1 this subject focuses on developing further all aspects of orthodontic treatment and inter-disciplinary management of patients with paediatric dental, periodontic, prosthodontic, endodontic and oral and maxillofacial surgery units at the Royal Melbourne (RMH) and Royal Children\u2019s (RCH) Hospitals.  Clinical training continues at the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne and the Melbourne Dental Clinic with all clinical training sessions having continued supervision with experienced orthodontists. The student will continue to engage with surgical team members at RMH and RCH in addition to interdisciplinary meetings within the Dental School.",
        "Mid-way through this year, students are rostered to the Craniofacial Unit at the RCH to assist orthodontists treating cleft palate and craniofacial patients, and participate in monthly interdisciplinary meetings.  At the end of this year, each student is further allocated approximately 10 cases.",
        "All students attend weekly diagnosis and treatment planning sessions of student and unseen cases which foster collegiate interaction and friendly debate on treatment options.",
        "DDS Teaching RequirementAll students are required to conduct seminars for the Doctor of Dental Surgery students, roughly 24 hours annually. This is undertaken in the second half of each year."
