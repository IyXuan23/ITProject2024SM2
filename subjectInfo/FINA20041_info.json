    "overview": [
        "The figure is one of the elements available to be manipulated by the designer in the development of a design for performance. An audience reads (either consciously or unconsciously) that figure through its relationship to its environment, and how it presents itself to the viewer.",
        "The human figure is in some ways the only element in a design that is non-negotiable in terms of scale, however it can be transformed through costume design, its relationship to space, its relationship to light and as represented through the puppet.",
