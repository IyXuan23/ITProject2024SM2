        "This subject is premised on the idea that certain key texts provide the means to gain insights and understanding of Aboriginal social realities and individual selves, in a manner qualitatively different to more empirically focused studies. Through deep and intensive readings, informed by appropriate theoretical perspectives, a selection of diverse Australian texts will be considered for the ways they meditate on the complex Australian past, produce visions for an Australian future and create deep intercultural connections."
