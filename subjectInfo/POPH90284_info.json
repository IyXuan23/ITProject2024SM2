        "The Research Project is a capstone option within the Master of Public Health. Within the Research Project students will work in their chosen area of study with an appointed supervisor. Students will have the opportunity to undertake a literature review, develop research questions and undertake the research activities required to answer their research question. Activities include analysis of data, policy analysis, a small evaluation of a health program, a small qualitative research study, a systematic or narrative review of the literature, or the development of a research protocol. Some activities are only available in specific streams of the course. Students enrolling in the year-long project MUST complete the project in two semesters consecutively."
