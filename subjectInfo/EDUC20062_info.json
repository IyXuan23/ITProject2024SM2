    "overview": [
        "How does your identity shape the art and media you consume and create, and the cultures and subcultures you\u2019re a part of? This subject will explore how young people engage with the arts (including visual arts, music and drama), and how this helps to form their cultural and social identities and develop and express individualities. This subject is taught in intensive mode with a combination of tutorials and a cultural site visit excursion. Students will participate in arts activities and create arts-based 'artefacts' to explore the links between the arts and youth identity. The subject supports students to understand the processes associated with art-making with young people, and develop essential skills such as leadership, collaboration, communication and personal and interpersonal expression. Students do not need existing experience in the practical arts."
