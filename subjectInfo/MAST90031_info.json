    "overview": [
        "The subject is about the use of generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial structures, including partitions of numbers, partitions of sets, permutations with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs, and other types of graph. The subject covers the solution of recurrence relations, methods of asymptotic enumeration, and some applications in statistical mechanics. The methods covered have widespread applicability, including in areas of pure and applied mathematics and computer science."
