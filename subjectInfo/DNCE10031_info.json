        "This subject advances practical dance skills in the context of Australian and international contemporary artistic and multi-cultural contexts.",
        "Building upon Dance Lab 1 and Body Knowledges, students further their understanding and embodiment of principles of practice, dance literacy and movement solutions to dance tasking. Techniques of dance and technologies of the body focus on core techniques involving contemporary, indigenous, ballet and dances of the Asia-Pacific region.",
        "Dance-music knowledge is supported by live music accompaniment by professional musicians. Somatics and dance science underpins teaching and learning in Dance Lab 2 to develop safe and resilient practice in an environment that encourages courageousness, care and awareness of self and other. Improvisation, repertory studies and interpretation of movement phrases amplify student learning and cultivate creative autonomous practice. Movement quality, spatial awareness, dynamic versatility, strength and control are emphasised in the development of an articulate practitioner.",
        "There is a focus on reflective learning through the lab-style classes which engage students in feedback, feedforward and journaling. Readings support engagement with current dance thinking and practice. This subject culminates in a First-Year studio performance at the end of semester where student learning is embodied and expressed through a devised dance work."
