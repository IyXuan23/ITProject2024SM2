        "This capstone subject is designed to put finance theory into practice and integrate a wide range of analytical skills developed by students enrolled in the Master of Management (Finance) and Master of Management (Accounting and Finance) programs. Working in groups, students will develop analyst reports on topics including firm valuation, capital structure, mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, and other contemporary issues and present these for assessment using a range of relevant pedagogical approaches. Upon successful completion of this subject, students will be able to apply the tools, techniques and approaches typically required of financial analysts that support decision-making in corporate finance and investment management."
