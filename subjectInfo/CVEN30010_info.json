    "overview": [
        "Geotechnical Modelling and Design is a capstone subject in geotechnical engineering, focusing on  strengthening fundamental soil mechanics knowledge and further expanding practical geotechnical engineering knowledge and modelling skills. Students will grasp knowledge through lectures, laboratory practicals, tutorials and computer workshops, where emphasis is paid on self-learning and problem-solving skills.",
        "In this capstone subject, students are required to finish a practical design project by applying their knowledge to solve a number of design problems while considering multiple and sometimes conflicting design criteria which aims to strengthen their problem-solving skills.  This project provides a good opportunity for the student to apply technical knowledge (e.g. soil mechanics, water seepage and slope stability analysis) and strengthen engineering design skills (e.g. problem solving approach, trade-off analysis, data management, software modelling, communications, presentation). This is to prepare the students for employment in the industry, as well as future study or research.",
        "This subject builds on knowledge gained in subjects such as Engineering Mathematics, Fluid Mechanics and Earth Processes for Engineering and assumes familiarity with concepts of civil and geotechnical engineering. This subject also delivers introductory material for engineering graduate coursework subjects including Geotechnical Engineering, Civil Hydraulics and Quantitative Environmental Modelling.",
        "The subject will cover topics such as basic soil mechanics, stresses in soils, effective stress principle, Coulomb failure criteria, site investigation, permeability and seepage, flow nets, the effect of seepage on stability, slope stability principles, landslides, design and remediation, trade-off analysis in engineering design, and computer modelling to solve engineering design problems."

            "Over approximately the first half of the semester, lectures in conceptual design and geotechnical engineering will be presented supplementing the basic technical knowledge required to undertake the design project. Worked examples will be provided at various times to illustrate the application of that knowledge. Students will also undertake one laboratory session during this period so that they can get some hands-on experience with seepage in soils. Over the last few weeks of the semester, lectures will focus on the systems approach to solving engineering design problem, with the assistance of optimisation techniques. Students will also be provided with an engineering design project at the beginning of the semester which they need to consistently work throughout the duration of the subject. Details of the design project and all necessary knowledge required, including the use of relevant software, will be provided during related lecture, tutorial and workshop sessions.INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCES",
            "A range of references will be provided to allow students to back up the basic information provided in lectures. This material will include specifically prepared notes on selected topics, PowerPoint presentations, worked design examples, manuals for software tools used in the design project and some online material.",
            "CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKSThe main link with this subject is that students will be able to develop many of the essential skills required for careers in engineering design, including both specific technical skills in geotechnical and hydraulic engineering and transferable skills such as problem solving, modelling, design and communication. The software tools used in the project are widely used in industry."
