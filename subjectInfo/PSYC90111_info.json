    "overview": [
        "TheWell-being in Practicesubject will provide its students with integrated well-being and clinical practice related knowledge, understanding and associated experiential learning resources and activities. This will help students develop an integrated theoretical and practical understanding of well-being, well-being improving techniques, clinical practice, and their interrelationship. The subject will include content on the measurement and evaluation of well-being and well-being improvement in response to various interventions. There will be a practical and experiential component in which students are challenged to actively apply well-being techniques in their own lives as well as help other people, including clients, apply them in their lives. Students will use a range of well-being improving techniques and evaluate their efficacy. Students will therefore develop a theoretical, personal and clinical understanding of the effectiveness of well-being improving interventions including mindfulness and behaviour change.",
        "Introductory clinical skills will be learned which have a broad range of valuable professional applications, embedded in a broad theoretical context which will allow deep learning including of how clinical psychology can enhance and protect well\u2010being, as well as optimally respond to a clinical lack of well\u2010being. The subject\u2019s content will be a progression from students\u2019 earlier clinical related content, and a preparation for their later clinical content.",
        "The subject will include online content modules supported by workbooks and journals. The workbooks will guide students through online learning content including multi\u2010media materials, videos and learning activities. Students will be paired with other students in tutorials to perform tasks designed to reinforce what they have learned in that week\u2019s workbook. The subject will also be supported by a suite of well\u2010being enhancing app\u2010based and other resources.",
        "These resources will support clinical techniques which will be covered in the course and will include clinical mindfulness, clinical behaviour change and clinical resilience building."
