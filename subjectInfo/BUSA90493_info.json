        "The aim of Business Analytics is to present students with a range of modern methods for extract relevant information from data to make improved business decisions.",
        "Big data is big business, but there are not enough managers who can ask the right questions and interpret the results of analysis effectively. Business Analytics is the science of extracting useful information from datasets, large and small. Many of the methods have been around for decades but only recently has the value that lies in business data repositories been realised.",
        "Effective analytics is about knowing which type of data to use for solving a business problem, and how to influence the organization to move from a \u2018decision\u2010based evidence making\u2019 mode to an \u2018evidence\u2010based decision making\u2019 mode."
