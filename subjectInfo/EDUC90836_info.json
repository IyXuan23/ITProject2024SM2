    "overview": [
        "The field of clinical education is rapidly developing in order to meet Australia\u2019s health workforce needs. The content of this subject addresses the multiple roles of health education leaders in this environment; to maintain and further develop evidence-based quality in education delivery and underpinning scholarship; to ensure clinical education curriculum and training produces competent and safe health care professionals, and to manage and effectively lead people across different levels of complex organisations.",
        "To equip students for these roles, this subject will cover theories and models of leadership and how concepts of leadership can be applied to health care education leaders. The subject content will be grounded in the context of current reforms in education and training.",
        "Recognising, responding, managing and leading clinical education in this context, requires clinicians with current or future clinical leadership responsibilities to have a scholarly grasp of leadership and change management theory. Students will also require skills in change management, leading in complex organisations, and methods of transformational, interpersonal and distributed leadership.",
        "Teaching/learning formats include case studies with small and full group discussions, interactive presentations, panel discussions and asynchronous learning via Canvas (videos, text, reflection and discussions). The informal exchange of insights and experiences among participants and invited lecturers drawn from multiple professional disciplines is a vital part of the experience."
