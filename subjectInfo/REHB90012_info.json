        "This 25 credit point subject is a capstone experience that will run over two consecutive terms, and will require students to integrate and apply an advanced body of knowledge and cognitive, technical and creative skills to design and complete a substantial professional project. Building on their previous learning and the University of Melbourne graduate attributes, the subject provides opportunities to extend, deepen and apply knowledge, skills and attributes in the context of a professional project. Students will conduct a professional project based on a needs assessment within their professional practice context, identifying and justifying priority service areas. Selecting a priority area in collaboration with an academic and professional mentor they will design, justify and present a program, service or resource, including a business case, to address the identified area of need and design a project to meet this need.",
        "This subject provides the opportunity for interdisciplinary networking; dissemination of project outcomes with student peers and colleagues; and peer review prior to submission of the final assessment task."
