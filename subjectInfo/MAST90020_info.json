        "Functional analysis is a fundamental area of pure mathematics, with countless applications to the theory of differential equations, engineering, and physics.The students will be exposed to the theory of Banach spaces, the concept of dual spaces, the weak-star topology, the Hahn-Banach theorem, the axiom of choice and Zorn's lemma, Krein-Milman, operators on Hilbert space, the Peter-Weyl theorem for compact topological groups, the spectral theorem for infinite dimensional normal operators, and connections with harmonic analysis."
