        "Chinese 4 is a post-elementary subject, a continuation of Chinese 3. It continues to focus on the understanding and use of the Chinese language, with emphasis on selected vocabulary, complex sentences and basic grammatical structures. By the end of this subject students should have mastered the basic grammatical structures of Modern Chinese and have a vocabulary of approximately 1000 characters. Students should have sufficient listening and speaking skills to cope with everyday situations in China. They should have basic knowledge of using Chinese language in Chinese cultural situations through practical activities.",
        "In the course of building up their linguistic competence, students will continue to expend their cultural awareness to prepare themselves in cross-cultural communication. Chinese texts will be supported by brief English introduction, video, audio or additional reading materials dealing with the cultural topics."
