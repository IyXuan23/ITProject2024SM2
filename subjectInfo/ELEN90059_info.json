        "Lightwave systems are fundamentally changing the way we communicate through broadband communications, helping clinicians to perform a range of medical procedures and diagnosis supported by advanced biomedical instrumentation, and even in the way we live in our homes through sophisticated interactive televisions and security systems.",
        "This subject will explore the physical principles and issues that arise in the design of lightwave systems often found in those key industry sectors. Students will study topics from: transmission of light over wave guides; production of light by lasers; light modulation; conversion of light signals to electrical signals; optical multiplexing and demultiplexing; light amplification; dispersion and dispersion compensation; optical nonlinearities; modulation and advanced detection schemes. This material will be complemented by exposure to lightwave systems and measurement techniques in the laboratory.INDICATIVE CONTENT",
        "This subject will explore the physical principles governing the generation, modulation, amplification, guiding, transmission, multiplexing, demultiplexing and detection of light and issues that arise in the design of lightwave systems such as transmission impairments, noise. Students learn selected examples of lightwave systems and methods for design, modelling and testing of simple lightwave systems."
