        "This subject equips students with increasingly sophisticated language and intercultural skills to communicate about the self and other in Spanish in a wider range of social contexts. On its successful completion, students will be able to comprehend and produce a variety of personal stories and critical texts. They will have the language skills necessary to comprehensively describe emotions, places and people and to use language appropriate to everyday informal and a growing number of formal situations. Reading authentic texts from newspapers, online sources such as blogs and social media, as well as shorter literary texts, and watching a number of award-winning short films from different Spanish-speaking countries, students will advance their in-depth knowledge in some areas of contemporary life in the Hispanic world. They will also learn to give their opinion, participate in debates, evaluate and report on ideas in the Spanish language, as well as showcase their growing communicative confidence in an audio-visual group project. Additionally, students will enhance their digital literacy and practice skills as well as a number of skills relevant to a workplace environment, such as problem-solving, teamwork, clear communication, self-evaluation, information literacy and professionalism.",
        "Part of the assessment of this subject will contribute to the ePortfolio students develop in their Spanish and Latin American Studies subjects. This digital platform offers the opportunity to showcase relevant workplace skills and digital and intercultural competencies in the target language, as well as individual interests and ideas."
