    "overview": [
        "This subject explores the making of sound from a physiological standpoint and tackles the many questions posed in the study of classical singing.",
        "Through both lectures and practical exploration, the subject explores the translation of multilingual singing imagery and terminology into singing practice.",
        "Moving beyond basic notions of postural organization, the subject focuses on developing dynamic, multidimensional movement patterns that support the functional unity of the voice given the rigorous demands placed upon it through stage and concert performance."

        "critically reflect on the root causes of physiological problems and the effect these have on vocal performance;",
        "demonstrate cognitive and observational skills to evaluate movement patterns in relation to their effect on vocal function and vocal quality;",
        "approach vocal study with a skill set of somatic practices that can offer a more streamlined approach to learning, bypassing many of the impediments that inaccurate and inefficient teaching styles provide;",
        "develop metacognitive strategies that reveal individual learning styles and how they can best be employed in reducing performance anxiety and improving motivation ;",
        "bring improved observational skills to bear on singing performance as revealed through new analytical perspectives."
