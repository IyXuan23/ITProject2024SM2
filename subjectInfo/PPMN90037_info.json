        "This subject examines contemporary issues in governance in Australia and internationally. The subject critically examines both traditional and emerging governance models that have dominated recent public sector reform efforts in many parts of the world. The subject focuses on the implications of these changes for the effectiveness, accountability and legitimacy of contemporary democratic governance. The subject will combine theoretical work regarding the nature of contemporary governance with studies of current debates around specific governance initiatives. The subject will look at a range of governance models operating in contemporary society and the implications of emergent governance models for politicians, public officials, non-governmental actors and citizens and the relationship(s) between global influences and emerging governance frameworks."
