Topics covered were chosen to reflect those methods and principles currently used in high-integrity systems engineering, and were informed by several industry experts from domains such as railway signalling and air-traffic management. Case studies used as part of the learning are real examples of critical systems from industry in which failure to operate dependably has resulted in serious injury, death, or severe damage.",
