    "overview": [
        "The Honours program in the Department of Pathology provides an introduction to the challenging area of investigation of disease processes at the cellular and molecular level. In this subject, advanced scientific lectures will be provided by experienced researchers discussing current scientific methods and their application to the study of pathological diseases. These lectures provide a foundation for critical analysis tasks which are consolidated during tutorials which assist students in reading and understanding scientific research articles. Students will be taught key learning objectives including, the application of scientific methods, how to write manuscript titles and abstracts, and in the art of critical analysis of scientific papers. The course is composed of 12 lectures and up to 8 tutorials. The lectures and tutorials are held during first semester."
