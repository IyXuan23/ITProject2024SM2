    "overview": [
        "The Cancer Research subject will provide students with an ability to apply research methodologies in the context of cancer. Students will learn about the structure and skills required to conduct successful research activities. There will be an introduction to a variety of methods for investigation including experimental and clinical trial design, methodology for population-based studies, ethical considerations, and statistical analyses. In addition, critical analysis of the literature will be embedded throughout the subject with exposure to the currently active areas of research in cancer. In the Cancer Research subject, students will be tasked with developing their own hypothetical cancer research project as part of the assessment portfolio. For students undertaking the full Masters course, this is an opportunity to explore a research topic of their choosing, which may inform their Research Thesis Capstone (MEDI90098/MEDI90099) project."
