        "This subject addresses the theory and practice of dance in situ. Practices of \u2018listening to Country\u2019, dancing-place and ecological dramaturgy are central to the subject and are introduced through site-specific enquiries.",
        "Body trainings that cultivate attunement to Country, earth, air and environment are taught within a residential context. Intercultural understandings in relation to Indigenous, immigrant and settler colonial experiences of place and body, underpin the exploration of different approaches to site-based dance and choreography.",
        "Coming to know a place through movement develops into choreographies of place that frame values, ecological perceptions and reciprocal relations."
