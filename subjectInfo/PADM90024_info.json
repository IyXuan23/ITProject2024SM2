    "overview": [
        "Responses to disasters and terror events require leadership, and many clinicians and health service managers anticipate taking on leadership positions or find themselves in leadership roles, without any formal education in leadership. This can have negative consequences for the leader, colleagues, patients and healthcare organisations. During such crises, leaders must be able to rapidly assess a complex situation, often with limited and fragmented information, while providing effective communication to colleagues, patients and healthcare organisations. The purpose of this subject is to provide clinical and health service leaders (and aspiring leaders) with knowledge of leadership practices during crisis management and the opportunity to implement this learning and acquire new skills. Subject content will be grounded in evidence-based knowledge produced by leadership scholars and practised by leaders in Disaster and Terror Medicine and Health Management.",
