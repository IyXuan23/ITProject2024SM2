        "Set theory, univariate calculus and optimisation are reviewed and applied to the theory of the firm and the theory of consumer demand. Linear algebra concepts including matrix operations, vector spaces and quadratic forms are introduced and applied to problems in economics and econometrics. Applications of multivariate calculus including constrained optimisation, the envelope theorem and Kuhn-Tucker conditions are covered."

        "Solve market equilibrium problems;",
        "Explain the geometry of constrained optimization, the geometry of Lagrange multipliers;",
        "Explain the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions, and their application at both interior and corner points;",
        "Solve matrix algebra problems including those involving quadratic forms and eigenvalues and vectors, and explain the connection between positive definite forms and convexity;",

        "Set up and solve Khun Tucker problems;",
        "Explain and interpret Lagrange multipliers as shadow prices;",
        "Solve problems involving simple comparative statics, both for optimization and equilibrium problems, using the univariate implicit function theorem, single crossing conditions and envelope methods."
