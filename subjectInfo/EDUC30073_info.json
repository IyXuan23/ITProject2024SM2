    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to engage students in the process of designing a proposal to lead change in a \u2018real world\u2019 problem.  It looks at the role sport plays within society as an agency for change at the grassroots level.  Students will have an opportunity to visit a range of sporting facilities and see first-hand how community programs are adapting to change and meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse population.  They will hear from a range of speakers who are experts in their respective fields, discussing the wider role of sport as a tool for change. The subject will explore sport in community settings and examine the educative role it plays dealing with issues such as disability, homophobia and social inequity. Students will investigate what community sport facilities and programs are currently doing to address these issues, and the leadership roles they have taken on.",
        "Areas covered include leadership, community development, teamwork, the design process and reflective practice. Processes include planning, reflective writing, teamwork and personal development."
