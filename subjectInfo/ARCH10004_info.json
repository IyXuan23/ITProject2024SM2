        "The subject is an introduction to history and theory in architecture and landscape architecture within the Bachelor of Design. To understand the making of built places, from the scale of the house to that of the city, the subject is built around three questions:",
        "What is the built environment and how is it formed and transformed?",
        "How do we analyse built places?",
        "How might we imagine and create better social and environmental outcomes in our built places through design?",
        "Using a contemporary city as its key case study, location for student fieldwork and the mapping of places, the subject is organised into four parts, addressing in turn: infrastructures, housing, health, and knowledge institutions."
