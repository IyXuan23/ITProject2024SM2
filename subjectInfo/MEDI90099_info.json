        "This subject enables students to engage in the implementation, analysis and communication of a research project that demonstrates their advanced theoretical knowledge and critical reflection skills. It provides the opportunity for integration of their prior learning from the course, and demonstration of their advanced practice, focusing on an area of interest. During this project, students will have the unique opportunity to be closely trained and supervised by leading experts in oncology.
