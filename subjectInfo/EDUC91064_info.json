        "This subject introduces and develops Teacher Candidates\u2019 practical and theoretical understandings of learning in and through the Arts, play-based learning and creative pedagogies in early childhood settings and primary classrooms. Teacher Candidates engage with Drama, Music and Visual Arts in relation to the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework\u2019s understandings of creative skills and play-based learning and the Victorian Curriculum, investigating their application as individual artforms and across the Arts Learning Area, the Capabilities, and the Cross-Curricular Priorities.",
        "Teacher Candidates are introduced to practical approaches to foreground Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives in and through the Arts in early childhood settings and primary schools. A range of resources (strategies, ideas, tools, techniques, digital technologies) are used to supporting young children\u2019s participation and engagement in arts-based experiences that cater for diverse learners. Teacher Candidates link their studio practice to relevant theory and practicum experience to formulate a rationale for their emerging arts pedagogy, with an emphasis on continued professional learning in the arts."
