    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to how science is undertaken in practice. Students will explore the fundamental concepts of the major scientific disciplines of chemistry, biology, physics and geology and their relationship with the environment. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of science for sustainable development and management of the environment.",
        "The subject will draw on content covered in the other subjects offered as part of the Diploma in General Studies Extended program to apply scientific theories and concepts to a range of real-life situations in order to utilise and reinforce concepts presented as part of the subject."
