    "overview": [
        "This subject develops students\u2019 understanding of the human body and movement relevant to dance movement therapy, emphasising the qualitative and expressive, as well as functional and anatomical aspects of movement. Basic principles of anatomy, physiology and bio-mechanics that underpin safe DMT practice will be introduced.",
        "Students will explore movement frameworks that underpin DMT practice with a primary focus on Laban Movement Analysis (LMA). Students will develop their skills in the use of LMA as a tool for observation and analysis of movement through experiential activities. Theories of developmental movement and influences of family, environment, culture and other systems on movement preferences will be critically examined."
