        "This subject focuses on the common challenges of designing a research project at PhD level. These include framing research questions in the context of the existing research literature, selecting and developing an appropriate and refined research strategy, and clarifying the stages of a research project. These are all elements required at Confirmation, and the intensive is intended to accelerate students\u2019 preparation toward that goal. The subject will be collaboratively taught to reflect the diversity of approaches to research across the many disciplines in the faculty."
