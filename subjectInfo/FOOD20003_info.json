    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces the basic concepts of both food science and nutrition. From a food science perspective, the subject will assist students in developing an understanding of the chemical structure and underlying nutritional biochemistry of food components, concentrating on carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, and how food processing affects these food components.",
        "From a nutrition perspective, the subject will assist students in developing an understanding of the nutritional aspect of food in the human body, covering basic physiological and biochemical processes.  There is a particular emphasis on the digestion, absorption, nutritional significance and health effects of the macro and micronutrients, and the basic biochemistry of energy metabolism.  Students will further explore the dietary concepts of energy balance and diet planning and the tools used in this process."
