    "overview": [
        "The weather controls the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. The atmosphere and oceans influence decisions about what we wear, how we travel, where we live and how we spend our weekends and holidays. This subject explores how the atmosphere and oceans determine many aspects of our lives. Questions such as what controls when and where it rains, the surf on a beach, ocean currents, seasonal snowfalls, and tropical cyclones will be explored. How the weather controls flooding and bushfire danger and why it is essential for water, energy and food security are discussed. Our health (heart attacks, allergies, respiratory and psychological wellbeing) is correlated with weather events. This subject will provide an introduction to understanding the weather and weather forecasting tools so important for the world we live in."
