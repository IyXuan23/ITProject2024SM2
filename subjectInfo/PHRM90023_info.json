    "subject name": "Pharmacology for Physiotherapy A",
    "subject code": "PHRM90023",
    "subject availability": [
        "Semester 1"
    ],
    "overview": [
        "This subject builds students' knowledge of the fundamental principles of pharmacology, which should be adopted and utilised to support medication management in the scope of physiotherapy practice. Students will use the foundational knowledge of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutics, in order to critically analyse how drugs affect physiological, biochemical and pathophysiological processes.",
        "With a greater appreciation of the action of drugs on body processes, students will be able to determine which medications should be administered to patients in order to ensure therapeutic effects are optimized and adverse effects are minimized. Students will articulate the key pharmacological characteristics of drug classes, as well as be able to derive and understand the specific nuances of individual drugs. They will understand the use of medications in persons with common cardiovascular, immune and inflammatory, musculoskeletal and respiratory conditions in preparation for clinical practice. This focus will ensure that students will be able to use critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in the use of medicines as a foundation for monitoring and evaluation of selected medications in a rational and effective manner. Students will analyse their personal and professional role in the use of drugs and will engage with current social debates on the use of medicines and drugs and their impact at a personal and population level.",
        "Please note that this subject is run and coordinated by the Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics."
