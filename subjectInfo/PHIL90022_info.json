        "Moral decision-making is a practical skill which we exercise many times a day, confidently and accurately. Sometimes, however, we face situations of moral complexity or novelty, where it is not obvious what we should do. In this subject, we look at the ways in which moral theory can assist us to think about such situations, particularly as they arise in our working and organisational life. We begin by examining the nature of moral reasoning, and then see how it can be applied to a number of ethical issues which we are likely to encounter in our professional lives. These issues may include, autonomy and paternalism, role morality and its relationship with personal morality, whistle-blowing, free speech in the workplace, personal and professional relationships, corruption and bribery, conflicts of interest, and privacy and confidentiality. We focus on the factors that help or hinder ethical action in organizational settings, including both structural elements (such as role clarity, avoidance of perverse incentives, accountability mechanisms) and personal traits (such as cognitive biases and moral (dis)engagement). Case studies will provide a focus for reflective work: students will be encouraged to develop case studies from their own experience, and pursue their own interests."
