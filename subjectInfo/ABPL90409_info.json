    "overview": [
        "Realising The Knowledge Economy develops a holistic approach to the understanding and realisation of the urban knowledge economy, i.e., an urban development strategy that draws upon knowledge-intensive sectors and activities. In particular, the implications and impacts of this strategy in property development and management, the planning of housing and infrastructure,  and the attraction of human capital and the (re)construction of our built environment will be critically discussed. The subject will cover the various theoretical bases for the centrality of knowledge to the performance of urban economies, these knowledge will be used to analyse different models of planning, development and management of key knowledge spaces. It will also cover how property, the labour market and our built environment react to a knowledge-based development strategy worldwide.",
        "Adopting a student-led learning approach, this subject is designed to capitalise on the multi-disciplinary nature of the student cohort. It uses case studies, active discussions, interactive problem solving, scenario analysis, peer review and group work, among other teaching and learning activities.  An essential part of this subject is a group fieldwork around Melbourne to collect data on selected innovation districts and precincts, which requires innovative applications of your learning",
