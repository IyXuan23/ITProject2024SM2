    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the application of dramaturgical practice in the rehearsal room in the lead up to performance outcomes. The subject is delivered through a variety of intensives and collaborative projects with students from other theatre courses (e.g. actors and directors).",
        "The projects may range in scale from table work to scene studies and rehearsed readings, and the focus of the subject is how to develop and apply a suitable dramaturgical practice within each context. The work in each project will span a range of possible activities including: reading/analysing script with a director; contextual research supporting the director\u2019s vision for the production/scene study; responding to work on the floor and identifying and discussing the implications of dramaturgical decisions.",
        "Drawing on the learning from Applied Dramaturgy 1, this subject will enable you to consolidate practice, leadership skills and understanding of dramaturgy in a range of contexts before undertaking your Independent Dramaturgy Project."
