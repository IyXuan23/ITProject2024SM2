        "Using clinical cases to illustrate principles, this subject examines the structure, function and potential for dysfunction of the cardiovascular system of the major domestic animal species. As students develop an understanding of the mechanisms of disease of this system, they will develop skills in the clinical evaluation of it and in the interpretation of relevant diagnostic procedures."

        "Explain the processes by which normal function of the cardiovascular system may be disrupted, and predict the outcomes of these perturbations for normal function of the animal",
        "Apply an understanding of the mechanism of action of common classes of drugs that act on the cardiovascular system to explain their use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease",
        "Conduct a clinical examination of the cardiovascular system in order to assess structure and function",
        "Interpret data acquired from clinical cases, and apply understanding of the structure and function of the cardiovascular system in order to analyse and interpret clinical problems related to this system"
