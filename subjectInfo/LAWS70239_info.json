        "Payment has always been at the heart of construction contracting, and payment disputes have been\u2014and remain\u2014at the centre of construction law case law. This subject aims to provide students with a detailed understanding of the contractual procedures for payment and associated issues such as set-off. Its major focus is upon the \u2018security of payment\u2019 reforms of recent years. This state and territory-based legislation was designed to simplify the payment stream and disputation yet, in practice, has spawned hundreds of court cases, further complicating the contracting landscape for construction projects. The lecturers are based in the two states that have been at the forefront of the reforms\u2014Queensland and New South Wales\u2014and are therefore well-placed to guide students through this area of law.",
