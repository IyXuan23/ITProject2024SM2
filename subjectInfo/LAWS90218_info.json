        "This subject canvasses 11 of the most challenging current questions in comparative constitutional law. It does so from a global perspective, which appreciates the diversity of constitutional arrangements across the world while acknowledging their interconnections and their many shared problems. The issues on which the subject focusses in 2021 range across questions of method to problems of substance and will be explored both conceptually and empirically. Topics include, for example, comparative constitutional methods, constitutional identity, constitutional pluralism and constituent power. Each seminar is led by a comparative scholar affiliated with Melbourne Law School, drawing on the resources of one of the leading comparative constitutional law centres in the world.",
