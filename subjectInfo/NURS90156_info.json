        "This subject examines the pathophysiological processes in the human body systems in response to alterations in body\u2019s structure and function.  Students engage in discussion on the integrated responses of the body to compensate for disease processes and how these translate to clinical signs and symptoms and nursing interventions."

        "Discuss the pathophysiology processes of common disorders that affect the human body and their clinical signs and symptoms;",
        "Discuss the role of genetic, epigenetics and environment on core pathophysiological processes in the human body across the lifespan;",
        "Identify the occurrence of common pathophysiological processes across the lifespan among children, adolescents, older adults within the Indigenous and non-Indigenous community;",
        "Identify the differences in prevalence of disease/risk factors for Indigenous and non-indigenous population;",
        "Interpret patient care plans within the context of evolving pathophysiological processes, clinical investigations and pharmacology and in accordance with relevant policies/ guidelines; and",
        "Utilise electronic databases to identify evidence-based information to support linking of core pathophysiological processes with nursing assessment and care planning."
