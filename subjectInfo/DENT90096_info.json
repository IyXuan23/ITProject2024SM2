    "overview": [
        "This subject covers the detection, diagnosis, treatment planning, prevention and care of diseases that affect the oral health of children. During the first year, students are equipped with skills and training needed to achieve this through 3-hour weekly seminars, operative technique modules on basic skills in paediatric dentistry, which includes advanced endodontics and interceptive orthodontics, and inhalation sedation training.",
        "This subject aims to provide the student a comprehensive understanding human growth and psychological development from pre-conception to adulthood and be able to detect abnormalities in growth and development. They will be able to comprehend the aetiology, management and outcomes of the full range of oral diseases both inherited and acquired, ranging from dental caries to periodontal disease, tooth wear to traumatic dental injuries, hypodontia to developmental dental defects. They will be able to understand the importance of the nature of each child and how their unique temperament, family and school environments and background can impact on oral health and the treatment planning for the delivery of oral health care. Childhood illness, congenital disorders and disability can influence oral health and oral health care. They will obtain a sound understanding and knowledge of contemporary research, best practice guidelines and evidence-based treatment relate to child oral health.",
        "The student will develop competencies to recognise diseases and their associated risk factors, and to provide the full range of clinical treatment services in the primary, mixed and permanent dentitions, including the management of children with the full range of medical, physical and intellectual conditions and disorders including those with behavioural challenges. They will learn to work in an inter-disciplinary environment of medical, dental, allied health professionals and to be able to advocate for child (oral) health and well-being."
