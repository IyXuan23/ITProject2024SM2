        "This subject provides relevant information to enable educational psychologists to work with children and adolescents with exceptional needs in regard to identification of exceptionality and appropriate assistance. This includes current policies and practices in regard to assessment, interventions, and recommendations to parents and other professionals working with these individuals. The subject is concerned with the full range of exceptionality, which includes a comprehensive range of disabilities and the related genetic origins, psychopathology and psychopharmacology as appropriate. An examination of key concepts for those with exceptionality is undertaken which includes definitions, characteristics, symptoms, and likely developmental consequences. Psychological aspects and issues arising from the identification of such individuals are considered in the context of current government policies of inclusion and research-based educational theories. Particular emphasis is placed on assessment, program implications, service delivery, and support in meeting the developmental needs of these individuals. The role of the educational psychologist when working with exceptional individuals, their parents, and multidisciplinary teams is explored."
