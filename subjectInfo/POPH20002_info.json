        "This subject will creatively expose students to key concepts and approaches within epidemiology and public health, through the lens of an island-dwelling population. From the very first lecture, a narrative will be established in which the students are public health professionals at the Department of Health of an island nation. Throughout the course of the subject, students will navigate challenges that threaten the health of the local island community, learning about topics such as infectious and non-infectious epidemiology, the social determinants of health, environmental threats to health, and scientific communication along the way. This engaging subject will see the students working in teams to apply their skills in a range of different scenarios that mirror current real-world health challenges with inputs from public health professionals working on these very challenges."
