    "overview": [
        "How did medieval writers conceptualise emotions, passions, and feelings? This subject will introduce students to a selection of medieval English texts in a range of narrative and dramatic genres that privilege different forms of emotional practice: romance, lyric, allegory, confessional writing, and religious texts, focusing on the crucifixion of Christ. The subject also offers a detailed study of Chaucer's magnificent Trojan love story, Troilus and Criseyde. We will read these texts through the frameworks of contemporary critical discussions of history of emotions and affect theory. No prior knowledge of Middle English is assumed in this subject, which is designed as an introduction to medieval literature and culture."
