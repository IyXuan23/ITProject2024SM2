        "Students are required to successfully complete field placements of a total of 80 days. Placements may take the form of a single 80-day placement or two 40-day placements. Students must do placements within one (if they choose to do an 80 day placement) or both (if they choose to do 2x40 day placements) of the speciality streams they select in Year 3. It should be noted that over the course of the Masters and Doctoral programs, students are expected to experience a range of placements (eg adult, child or older age placement, specialist placement). Students are also required to participate in the Clinical Case Conference.",
        "Supervisors will be registered psychologists and will also normally be members (or eligible for membership) of the College of Clinical Psychologists of the Australian Psychological Society. The field supervisors will be responsible for ensuring that students are adequately introduced to the field setting and for day-to-day supervision of the student's placement. Field Supervisors will ensure that students are exposed to a range of clinical work, as far as possible allowing the student to function as a Clinical Psychologist within the facility.",
