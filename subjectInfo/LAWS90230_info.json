    "overview": [
        "It is well-known that the trust is a significant device that provides the foundation for a wide range of domestic and commercial arrangements in common law jurisdictions. Trusts law is also flourishing in the Asia-Pacific region: with a rich diversity of legal traditions, cultures, and history, the trust has been (and is being) used in an increasing variety of ways to meet a range of different needs. However, the existence, influence, and development of trusts law in Asia are under-discussed.",
        "This subject explores, from theoretical and practical perspectives, the influence and potential of trusts law across the Asia-Pacific region. The subject begins by exploring the rationales and benefits of a comparative study of trusts law in Asia-Pacific. It traces the history of trusts law diffusion in both common law and non-common law jurisdictions across the region, and considers how trusts law has been used to regulate customary/religious property-holding forms. In doing so, the subject critically assesses the (re)conceptualisation of the trust undertaken by non-common law jurisdictions in order to transplant the trust. The subject then considers the reach of constructive and resulting trusts in Asia-Pacific, before moving on to examine the different uses of the trust in the region \u2014 in the family context, in the commercial context, as well as a financial product in offshore and mid-shore jurisdictions. Finally, it discusses the private international law perspective, focusing on the issue of choice of law.",
