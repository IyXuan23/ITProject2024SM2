Students in this subject will explore this question as they discover how diverse disciplines from accounting to marketing, interact to build sustainable businesses and a robust economy. Through rich case studies, employing perspectives from all the major disciplines in commerce, students will debate and discuss how business and economics influences society today, and helps shape the future. Students will be required to apply their knowledge through a variety of learning experiences including teamwork, self-paced online activities, and individual reflection. Providing context to their development as a professional in the business and economics disciplines, students will explore aspects of people and place; respect and inclusion; University values and freedom of speech; academic integrity and good scholarly practice; and wellbeing."
