    "overview": [
        "BioDesign Innovation is a \u201creal world\u201d, team-based subject in creating successful medical devices. Teams will consist of 2-3 students from the MBA program and 2-3 students from engineering disciplines, along with individuals with medical and law backgrounds to conceive and design an innovative medical device, taking it through all steps of development. The teams will create an engineering prototype of their invention, draft a provisional patent application, and compose a detailed business plan; team members are expected to contribute primarily according their specialisation.",
        "BioDesign Innovation is given over three terms of one academic year and is composed of frontal lectures, practical training, and a guided project. The subject is taught by a combination of academics and guest speakers such as medical device entrepreneurs, corporate executives, intellectual property attorneys and venture capitalists. As such, it provides a unique opportunity to gain real world experience while still in an academic environment.",
        "This subject is only available to students admitted to MC-BAPT, or students with permission of the MBA course coordinator. There is an application process for this subject, and students are required to have achieved a H2B average or better in their course."
