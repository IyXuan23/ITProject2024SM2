    "overview": [
        "This subject together with EDUC90846 Learning Intervention 2 comprises the compulsory [AQF] Capstone experience for Stream A of the Master of Learning Intervention (MLI) course encompassing the three separate specialties of Deaf Education (DE), Learning Difficulties (LD) and Disability (D).",
        "This subject will introduce students to various approaches in educational research across the three specialties. This will include a focus on the use of research to inform and improve education practice for students with disabilities, learning difficulties or hearing loss. It will be structured around an investigation of several major methodologies used in such research, researching educational practice (REP), ethical issues with practitioner research, using literature, and classifying research by purpose and method.",
        "Students will apply their learnings when undertaking a 15 day practicum placement in an educational setting that includes learners with disability, learning difficulties or hearing loss. They will engage in directed observation and interaction with learners, refining skills in planning, implementing and evaluating educational interventions.",
        "Students will complete a literature review and an extensive case study developed after a continuous process of assessment, data collection, intervention and evaluation with a learner with disabilities, learning difficulties or hearing loss in areas such as language, literacy, numeracy, mental health/well-being, thinking and learning, exceptionality, behaviour and audiology."
