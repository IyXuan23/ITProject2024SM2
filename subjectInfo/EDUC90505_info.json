    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces the topic of brain function, the way language is processed in the brain, and the impact of sensory and/or language impairment on development. It will consider models of information processing and speech perception and the impact of deafness on how we hear and process sound. The impact of otitis media and auditory processing disorders on language development, learning and implications for classroom management will be explored. Indigenous ear health and hearing loss will also be considered. Students will learn to interpret audiological test results and understand the fitting and use of sensory aids and other assistive listening devices. Students will learn about auditory development and how to develop children\u2019s listening skills. Students will learn to evaluate the listening environment."
