        "In this subject, students undertake a substantial research program in the area of Mathematics and Statistics. The research will be conducted under the supervision of a member of the School's academic staff. A list of the research interests of the School of Mathematics and Statistics is outlined on thewebsite of the School. The results of the research will be reported in the form of a thesis and an oral presentation.",
