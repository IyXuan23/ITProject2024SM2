    "overview": [
        "This subject is the third in a series of four MD Discovery subjects embedded within the Doctor of Medicine course. Students will engage in a total of 87.5 credit points of discovery-based learning in areas of interest across their course. Discovery learning allows medical students to engage in flexible, personalised and increasingly complex situational learning as they progress, providing opportunities to reflect on the professional practice of medicine in a variety of contexts and settings.",
        "In the final two years of Discovery students will choose to extend their knowledge and skills in one of two pathways based on their learning needs and interests: the clinical scholar or research scholar pathway.",
        "In Discovery 3: Integration students will select the clinical scholar pathway in line with their interest in clinical leadership, integrated clinical scholarship and health advocacy. The Clinician Scholar pathway leads students towards an integrated clinical placement in Discovery 4: Clinical Scholar, with a more clinically engaged scholarly output. The level of scholarship demonstrated through core coursework and Discovery will meet all training requirements to begin a career as a medical clinician-researcher.",
        "The topics in Discovery 3 Integration give students a choice of options to gain deeper insights into an area about which they are passionate and possibly pursue this in the following year. Alternatively, the subjects can provide a stand-alone learning experience within the course.",
        "Students may choose to build on learning they gained in the subjects Discovery 1: Foundation and/or Discovery 2: Application\u2019 or they can choose to explore a completely different topic of interest. Each of the learning options available within this subject is designed to enhance the student\u2019s personal and professional growth. The subject will be delivered as a four-week intensive and employs blended delivery and integrated experiential learning experiences."
