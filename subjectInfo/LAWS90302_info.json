    "overview": [
        "Early on in the 2000s, many commentators predicted that the 21st century would experience the \u2018rise of Asia\u2019. This assessment was based on several factors, including the growing dominance of Asian nations such as China and India in several spheres, including the growth of their domestic populations, their domestic economies, and their increasing power on the geo-political stage. Nearly a quarter century on, it is time to assess the strength of such claims.",
        "This subject seeks to do so by providing an overview of the theory and practice of constitutionalism focusing on the experience of four Asian jurisdictions, drawn from South and Southeast Asia: India, Indonesia, Singapore and Sri Lanka. Two of these are among the largest, most pluralistic nations in the world, while the remaining two are small island states. All four nations experienced long periods of colonial rule, which continues to have a decisive impact on their post-colonial legal and constitutional orders. The experience of colonialism contrasts quite starkly from those nations which were settler colonies, and this is an important focus of the course. In each of these nations, discussions about constitutionalism have become enmeshed within larger societal debates about economic development, cultural values, and human rights.",
