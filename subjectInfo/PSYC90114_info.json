        "This subject builds upon content and skills learned in PSYC90113 Professional Psychology Skills 1. Students will receive training in the rationale for mental state examinations within a comprehensive psychological assessment, practice key interviewing skills required to conduct an examination and write up an examination report from a hypothetical case. Students will receive a theoretical understanding of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and provide a formulation of psychopathology and resilience, before practicing key strategies and applying that to a hypothetical case. Students will learn about the nature of psychological risk, the requirements of risk assessment, how to conduct an assessment, and how to intervene appropriately. The subject will include opportunities for students to practice newly acquired skills through role-plays and simulated client interactions."
