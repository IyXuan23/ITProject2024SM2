        "This subject introduces students to the nature of accounting and its role in both financial markets and within organisations. Topics covered provide an overview of key financial and management accounting concepts and include: the constituent elements of financial statements; recognition, measurement and disclosure issues in the preparation of financial statements; accounting policy choices available to managers for key assets and incentives associated with policy choices; the analysis and interpretation of financial statement data; the use of accounting information within organisations to support managerial planning, control and decision making. The coverage and treatment of material in this course is specifically designed to meet the needs of undergraduate students from all disciplines. The focus is on the informed use of accounting information rather than the preparation of accounts."
