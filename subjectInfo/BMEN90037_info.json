    "overview": [
        "This subject teaches fundamentals of data analysis as relevant to modern biomedical engineering, in an integrated approach that combines theory with highly contextualised, project-based learning. Students are introduced to the foundations of probability and random variables, statistical hypothesis testing, linear and nonlinear regression, data classification and dimensionality reduction techniques. Each topic is explicated via case studies from clinical, industrial and research applications of biomedical engineering, covering topics in biomechanics, biosensors, bioinformatics, biomedical imaging and biomaterials."
