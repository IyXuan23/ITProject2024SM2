    "overview": [
        "This subject examines the challenges and opportunities associated with change across Asia, with particular reference to South Asia \u2013 including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and Bhutan.",
        "The subject begins with an introduction to key dimensions of Asia\u2019s history and current cultural, economic, social, and political characteristics, drawing comparisons between South Asia and other regions. The subject then examines what we can learn about culture, politics and development through a focus on South Asia, South-East Asia and East Asia, and in relation to five questions (two weeks per question). (1) To what extent has the market-focused reform of Asian economies transformed the standing of these countries, reduced poverty, and generated hope, and how is South Asia faring relative to other parts of Asia? (2) How should we understand the relationship between democracy and authoritarianism in Asia and how new social movements and mobilizations reshaping Asia and creating new ideas about \u2018hope\u2019? (3) How are Asian countries engaging with environmental threats, incorporating perspectives from environmental science? (4) How does South Asia influence global culture, for example through yoga, the growth of Bollywood, and in areas such as art and design \u2013 and what opportunities does such cultural practice open up for global engagement? (5) How has Covid-19 affected culture, politics, and development in Asia, incorporating perspectives from the Nossal Institute of Global Health?",
        "Throughout the subject, we will encourage students to reflect on the different forms of evidence (quantitative, qualitative, textual, visual, historical etc.) that are used to develop an understanding of challenges and hope in Asia.",
        "Throughout we also reflect on the nature of young people\u2019s lives in Asia and the connecting theme of \u2018hope\u2019."
