    "overview": [
        "This capstone subject will give all students majoring in Screen and Cultural Studies the opportunity to experience a research and/or industry guided learning program which seeks to locate the discipline in the wider context of contemporary issues, foster an adventurous approach to new knowledge and explore a range of innovative and creative presentation formats. Three distinct components inform the learning experience.",
        "We begin with an intensive workshop over two days where students will be offered a number of provocations on how Screen and Cultural Studies can be located in the contemporary landscape of humanities scholarship and how research within the discipline responds to pressing social, political, and cultural issues. Building on these reflections students will have the opportunity to formulate a semester-long supervised project aimed at building and enhancing experiential learning and working as part of a dynamic team. Although students will have the opportunity to choose their projects, they will work as part of a broad research theme with academic and industry supervision and engagement. The subject will culminate in the presentation of research projects in innovative and imaginative modes and in ways that are informed by the intended audience or outcome, including review blogs, policy reports, photo essays, video documentary, festival programming, and websites."
