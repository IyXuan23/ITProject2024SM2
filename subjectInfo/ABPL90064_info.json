    "overview": [
        "This subject was previously known as Planning Urban Sustainability.",
        "",
        "Humans have altered the earth's natural environment to such an extent, that scientists are considering the determination of a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. Climate change is one of many indicators of these significant human driven changes to the environment.",
        "",
        "This subject will provide students with an understanding of the key factors contributing to changes to natural and built environments, and their centrality to urban planning activities. Students will critically analyse the complex interrelationship between environmental processes, climate change, urban change, sustainability goals and urban planning policies. Current urban planning issues including: sustainability, climate change, resilience, and vulnerability will be critically analysed and applied to current and future problems. Local and global examples will be drawn upon. This approach will equip students with the capability to propose urban planning solutions to address climate change and facilitate urban sustainability.Through completion of this subject students will be provided with exposure to cutting edge urban planning approaches to address climate change and sustainability. Students will be well prepared to take elective subjects which focus in detail on environment, resilience and sustainability topics."
