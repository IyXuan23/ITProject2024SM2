        "DF_Lab: Designing Makingis part of the Digital Design and Fabrication Electives, which offer students the opportunity to build and demonstrate expertise and competence in the understanding and application of contemporary design tools that inform and shape students\u2019 design process and thinking. Digital Design and Fabrication Electives are based on a culture of experimenting and making \u2013 applying contemporary design and making tools to create advanced physical and digital artefacts and environments. For more detailed information concerning the respective tutors, design approaches and previous examples as well as other offerings in the Digital Design and Fabrication Electives suite please check on the ADD+F Research Hub website under teaching and learning:https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/addf",
        "DF_Labintroduces students to the use of software and hardware components, which are used in leading design practices today and are becoming increasingly important tools for future practice in architecture, landscape architecture and construction. The design process may involve the development and design of bespoke machines for fabrication.",
        "DF_Lab students learn and demonstrate the capability to prototype, using digital design and fabrication techniques, including e.g. laser cutters, 3d printers and CNC routers, combined with physical computing devices to augment existing fabrication techniques. Students will design and reimagine fundamental architectural elements and demonstrate how digital fabrication technologies are able to re-define and re-invent tectonic, aesthetic and performative qualities of fabricated building components.",
