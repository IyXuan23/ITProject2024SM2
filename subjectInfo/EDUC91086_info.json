    "overview": [
        "This subject extends and consolidates Teacher Candidates\u2019 mathematical content knowledge and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge for the effective teaching and learning of Mathematics in Victorian Primary Schools. The content focus is Statistics and Probability, and Number and Algebra using the four proficiency strands from the Australian/Victorian Curricula.Within this strand, Teacher Candidates will analyse the development of key concepts in primary mathematics and identify critical progression points for children\u2019s learning. They will consider typical conceptions and misconceptions held by children, their likely causes, diagnostic tools to diagnose them and teaching strategies for changing them.",
        "Teacher Candidates will consider research and practitioner literature related to selected key issues of teaching Statistics and Probability, and Number and Algebra (with a focus on Algebra and computational thinking). Teacher Candidates will learn to critically evaluate mathematics programs, resources and teaching strategies. They will review and critique approaches to unit planning and teaching resources. Teacher Candidates will examine tasks to develop critical statistical literacy skills. They will review assessment tools and approaches designed to achieve specific learning outcomes.Teacher Candidates will reference Victorian and Australian curriculum documents and resources when planning units of work, designing classroom assessment and implementing effective use of appropriate resources. Teacher Candidates will consolidate their skills in differentiating within the mathematics classroom and engage in the Clinical Teaching Model to target teaching to the needs of all students. By widening their appreciation of exemplary mathematics teaching, Teacher Candidates are expected to develop reflective mathematics teaching practices."
