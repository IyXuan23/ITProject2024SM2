    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to advanced imaging technologies and the methods for extracting quantitative information from multi-source imagery. This subject builds on the knowledge of subjects such as imaging the environment, by considering multi-source images of the target to provide additional information such as the distance from the target to object from which a three-dimensional representation can be constructed. It also considers imaging of targets where illumination is provided by the instrument rather than natural light reflection or radiation from the target. Students who successfully complete this subject may find work in a variety of remote sensing or specialist consultancies or agencies. The techniques learnt may also be applied to other industries such as quality control in manufacturing or recording of archaeological sites.",
        "The subject is of particular relevance to students wishing to establish a career in infrastructure engineering, civil engineering, property management, surveying, spatial information and urban planning but is also relevant to a range of disciplines where 3D building information should be considered."
