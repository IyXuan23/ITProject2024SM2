    "overview": [
        "Globally, non communicable diseases account for over two thirds of all deaths, and over half of disability adjusted life years. While non communicable diseases have sometimes been assumed to impact only on wealthy countries, they are in fact a major health and development challenge. Around 80 percent of non communicable disease-related deaths occur in low and middle income countries. Nations with the highest non communicable disease burden include some of Australia\u2019s closest neighbours, particularly island states in the Pacific, where over 70 percent of mortality is now due to non communicable diseases. The growing non communicable disease burden is of critical importance to global health and development because it impacts on economic growth, increases levels of poverty, and leads to premature death. Non communicable diseases also have major social and fiscal implications for governments and communities.",
        "In this subject, students will gain a practical understanding of the epidemiology, determinants, consequences and global health responses to the non communicable disease epidemic. The subject promotes students\u2019 exploration of the nexus between non communicable diseases and disability, non communicable diseases and infectious diseases, and non communicable diseases within the broader public health and global development agenda. The subject will contribute to enabling a new generation of public health professionals to address non communicable diseases through appropriate policy, programmatic and advocacy responses in Australia and globally.",
        "Non Communicable Disease & Global Health is a dual delivery block mode intensive subject. This means that the assessable material is delivered through self-directed online modules that students complete over a two-week period. The online modules offer flexibility in relation to the timing of when students complete them, or what hours of the day you may choose to study. However, allocated modules must be completed in time to allow effective participation in live interactive sessions that are linked with those modules. Live interactive sessions are held on six days across the two-week period, in which module material is discussed with fellow students and lecturers. Students may choose to attend these live sessions online or face to face. Students are expected to commit approximately 40 hours to learning each week, comprised of learning modules, reading, discussion board activities, group work and live sessions. This two-week teaching period is followed by independent learning towards two pieces of assessment to be completed over six weeks."
