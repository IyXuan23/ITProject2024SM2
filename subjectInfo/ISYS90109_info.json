    "aims": [
        "Students undertake an original investigation of a topic relevant to Information Systems (or cognate discipline). Specific research projects will depend on the availability of appropriate expertise, but may address a range of issues within Information Systems research. Under the supervision and guidance of an academic researcher, students are required to design and conduct a research investigation. This would typically involve a literature review, data collection and data analysis. The results will be reported as a thesis and in a public presentation. In some instances, it is expected that the results will also be submitted for publication in a conference or journal.",
