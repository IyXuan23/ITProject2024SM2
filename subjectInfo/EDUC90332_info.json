        "This subject investigates the role and structure of the DP curriculum framework. Key issues explored will include challenges for learning and teaching in relation to: breadth/depth/specialisation; higher order thinking; subject integrity/transdisciplinarity; individual/community/ social/global consciousness; and assessment. Participants will explore individual components of the IB framework including CAS, EE and TOK. There will be a strong theoretical and critical evaluation on the development and implementation of curriculum that is intended to support both the acquisition of essential knowledge and skills, and the search for meaning."
