    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces more advanced methods of structural analysis and design, and their applications to the engineering of reinforced concrete and structural steel in compliance with the standards. Students will be given the opportunity to integrate the use of different materials into the design of contemporary structures through design projects. This subject would typically be that final subject in the sequence of structural engineering subjects for civil engineering students who do not want to specialise in structural engineering.",
        "Topics covered include: structural analyses of beams and frames by the stiffness matrix method; finite element analyses; computer analysis using commercial software package; structural design of reinforced concrete beams, slabs and columns; structural design of steel beams, columns and connections; consideration of sustainability in structural design."

In addition, students will undertake a design exercise that involves applying the learnt techniques in solving problems that are likely to be encountered in practice.INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCESStudents will have access to lecture slides, recommended reading materials, Australian Standard AS3600 for the Design of Concrete Structures, Australian Standard AS4100 for the Design of Steel Structures, EXCEL spreadsheets showing examples of numerical simulations and SPACE GASS package. The subject's LMS site also contains worked solutions for all tutorial problems.CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKSRepresentatives from Steel Reinforcement Institute of Australia will contribute to the teaching of the subject. In addition, practising structural engineers will also contribute to the teaching of the subject and give advice on the assignment exercises.",
            "Students who successfully complete this course would typically find employment in a civil engineering consultancy or contracting company and could use the knowledge from this subject to propose designs or design variations under the supervision of a chartered professional engineer."
