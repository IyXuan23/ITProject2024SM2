    "overview": [
        "All students complete a foundation sports medicine theory & practice module Clinical Athlete Management,  underpinned by the human tissue response to exercise and injury. Theory and practice of acute injury management and rehabilitation for sport are explored, including medical interventions, internal medicine as it relates to physical activity, therapies, exercise intervention and load management. The clinical decision-making process is emphasised across the intervention spectrum from injury, recovery, return to sport and enhancing athletic performance.",
        "",
        "Students then select 2 from 3 Clinical Practice in Context Modules within which to integrate and apply this knowledge to inform an evidence-based, prioritised approach to injury and illness management for sports and exercise.",
        "1.Evidence, Athletes and Decisions. This module explores the evidence relating to management of specific neuro-musculoskeletal conditions and its application in specific case scenarios.2.Measurement & Management of the Kinematic Chain. In the context of case scenarios, this module evaluates the kinematic chain contribution to injury; and management of pathomechanics.3.Illness and Exercise Medicine. In the context of case scenarios, this module explores illness and exercise capacity, exercise intervention in chronic illness, and medical management of athletic scenarios including \u201cthe tired athlete\u201d.",
        "",
        "The final Integration, Contribution & Reflection Module entails communicating management plans and clinical reasoning explored in the Streaming Modules to student-peers who represent the interdisciplinary team. Interdisciplinary Case Conferences are simulated, including contribution and feedback from Experts in relevant fields. This provides opportunity for interdisciplinary scrutiny, contribution and reflection on best practice in sports and exercise case-management.",
