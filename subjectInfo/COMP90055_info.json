        "This subject involves in-depth investigation of a significant problem related to Computing. The subject also provides students with skills and knowledge for analysing and solving problems, and enhanced written and oral communication skills.",
        "The subject is a research-based project, giving a capstone experience and piece of scholarship to students that is suitable as a pathway to PhD.",
        "Enrolment in this subject requires a weighted average mark of 75 or above.",
        "Completing enrolment into the subject will give students access, via the LMS, to information about possible topics, supervision, and timelines. Students should negotiate a project topic with a project supervisor before the start of semester. The topic must be relevant for the student\u2019s specialisation, broadly interpreted. Students who are in doubt about the suitability of a chosen topic can contact the degree coordinator for an opinion about its suitability.",
        "By the end of Week 1 of semester, students must formally register their project, using an online form available via the LMS. If a chosen topic is deemed unsuitable, students will be alerted about this by the degree coordinator. Note that the degree coordinator's approval is an assessment hurdle requirement; if approval is not obtained, enrolment in the subject will be cancelled, until an acceptable project can be found."
