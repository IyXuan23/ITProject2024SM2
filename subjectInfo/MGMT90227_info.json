    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the design, structure, and processes for creating and managing an entrepreneurial enterprise both operationally and strategically. A key consideration will be the role of leaders and the challenges these leaders need to overcome over the phases in the life of the enterprise, through launch, growth and maturity. An understanding of the alignment of human resources, people and talent, leadership, culture and operational practices to match strategic goals as the entrepreneurial enterprise responds to the changing internal and external challenges is pivotal to the success of any entrepreneurial endeavour and will be a key focus of this subject. Furthermore, the subject will discuss new ways of organising that facilitate entrepreneurial outcomes, like, for example, the holacracy model, platform-based ecosystems, and the Rendanheyi model."
