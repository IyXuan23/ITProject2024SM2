        "In this subject, students are challenged to innovate their own forms of screen producing practice. Teaching focuses on practice-led and research methods that have contributed to new forms of screen practice. This involves exploring some of the social, aesthetic and intellectual histories of screen practice and drawing on recent international innovations as case studies.",

Students are required to enrol in FLTV90043 Producing in Industry: Research Part 1 (12.5 points) and FLTV90044 Producing in Industry: Research Part 2 (12.5 points), consecutively, for a total enrolment of 25 points.",
