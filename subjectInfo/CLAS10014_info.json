    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed for students who have completed Latin 1, Latin 2 (or Intensive Beginners Latin) and Latin 3. Students read an extensive extract (usually a book) from a Latin epic poem, such as Virgil'sAeneid, Ovid'sMetamorphoses, Lucan'sBellum Civile, or Lucretius\u2019De Rerum Natura. In addition, work is undertaken on grammar and syntax to revise, consolidate and extend students\u2019 knowledge of the language.",
        "Depending on the text being taught, students will explore the themes and content of epic, such as warfare, empire, heroic culture, ethnic identity and masculinity, the value of poetry for philosophical expression, and consider how the mythic past is used to reflect upon the author\u2019s own time. On completion of the subject students should develop a good knowledge of a key Roman text and an enhanced understanding of Roman literary culture. Students who complete this subject may progress to Latin 5."
