        "This subject reviews and consolidates all areas of Radiology and its associated pathology.. It aims to continue to enhance observational, higher level  analytical and communication skills of radiology trainees in their 4th year of RANZCR training with a specific focus on student preparation for the RANZCR Part 2 examinations.This subject represents the culmination of the formal teaching program and aims to solidify the participants approach to clinical competencies expected of a consultant radiologist. As such it covers all body systems  at a more advanced level, building on skills and knowledge gained from the earlier core subjects.Students will consolidate and improve upon a broad range of competencies, knowledge and understanding of key radiological diagnoses across a variety of imaging modalities for effective patient management and care.Teaching methods include interactive tutorial case based sessions facilitated by subspecialist expert radiologists and pathologists, with a focus on case based learning blueprinted to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) curriculum.",
        "Assessment tasks include oral case based and formal written examinations."
