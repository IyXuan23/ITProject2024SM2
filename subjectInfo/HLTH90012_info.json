        "This capstone internship subject for the Master of Genomics and Health is designed to provide students a practical experience with organisations related to their interests. Students will undertake two professional internships. Organisations may include, but are not limited to, health settings, research and educational institutes, pathology/diagnostic services, community organisations, and government organisations. Students will work across a range of tasks relevant to the organisation\u2019s objectives, and will develop and complete a specific project or professional portfolio in discussion with the host organisation and the Subject Coordinator. The internship experience will enable students to extend and apply the knowledge acquired during the Master of Genomics and Health. Internships will provide students with valuable professional experience, and integrate their academic learning, employability skills and attributes. Furthermore, these opportunities will extend their professional networks.",
        "The Subject Coordinator will be responsible for securing these internships by identifying suitable professional work environments. The students will work under the guidance of a senior staff member at the host organisation, with additional support from the Subject Coordinator, who will provide ongoing monitoring of student work and progress, and may conduct site visits."
