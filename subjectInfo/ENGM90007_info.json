    "overview": [
        "AIMSIn this subject students will learn about how to evaluate the feasibility of a project and then to define, structure and organise the initial planning phase for both construction projects and complex projects (e.g. IT, high technology projects). The interaction between commercial expectations and project management approaches will be considered broadly based on process and systems thinking. The subject builds on and integrates knowledge from CVEN90043 Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering and/or MCEN90010 Finance and Human Resources for Engineers where the fundamentals of economic appraisal is described, the planning approaches detailed in subject CVEN90045 Engineering Project Implementation and the fundamentals of risk management for which detailed approaches are provided in MULT90014 Business Risk Management. The subject is particularly important for students wishing to understand how to structure and scope projects such that they are well planned on the basis of triple bottom line thinking and the project management processes are efficiently structured.INDICATIVE CONTENTTechniques considered include the use of logic maps, business cases and system based project management concepts. Details include the development of acquisition strategies, system life-cycle, boundaries, scope management and mechanisms to control of client expectations and assist them to make sound project decisions leading to the sanctioning of a project. Expected value and Monte Carlo techniques are used as tools to refine project decisions based on risk evaluation.Project governance arrangements are considered along with cultural context, resourcing requirements of a project and how this is organised and managed. Specific areas considered include the selection of consultants or contractors, communication processes, industrial relations, occupational health and safety, meetings, delegation and leadership."

            "LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODSThe subject is based principally on presentations by experienced industry and academic professionals who outline both theory and project management processes as illustrated by project case studies. A major case study is dissected throughout the subject with students working in groups and as individuals to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the project management practices adopted. Workshop dialogue sessions are convened by the lecturer to assist students reflect on the topics presented. In addition to specific assignment work students prepare and present a poster on an aspect of systems based project management.INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCESBackground reading on a systems approach to project management is available:Blanchard, B.S. and Fabrycky, W.J., 2005,Systems Engineering and Analysis. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall International.CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKSPresenters from industry provide insights via the case studies presented. Reference materials are frequently industry based guidelines. Students who are already working in the industry can base their assignment on a project related to their workplace. The main case study dissected throughout the subject is a real and current project."
