        "\u2018Indigenous Research\u2019 is the core subject in the Professional Certificate in Indigenous Research (ProfCertIR), and is offered as a semester long blended course, comprising online and face-to-face components.The subject explores research and develops research skills from an Indigenous perspective, covering: selecting and refining a thesis topic; research design, methods and methodology; reviewing the literature; ethical issues in Indigenous research; intellectual property and copyright; establishing effective relationships with supervisors; managing scholarly information; qualitative and quantitative data collection, analysis and presentation; and planning and writing a thesis.",
        "The subject is taught in a mixed mode of seminars, case studies, and group activities, with an emphasis on collaborative learning. The format is interactive, with each session facilitated by an academic leader and/or panel of academics. Students engage in a range of activities, including structured reflection, academic writing, and formal verbal presentations. Students\u2019 assessment tasks relate directly to their own research.",
        "Upon satisfactory completion of the core subject, students are awarded a Professional Certificate in Indigenous Research, which will give them 25 credit points towards the Graduate Certificate in Indigenous Research and Leadership."
