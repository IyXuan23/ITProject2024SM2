        "All students will complete a foundation module Sport Psychology Unpacked.

Students evaluate their own skills and behaviours, and recognise the influence of their approach on athletes/clients, supporting personnel and outcomes. Areas of knowledge addressed include theory of communication and learning; biopsychosocial aspects of sports & exercise medicine; sport psychology for performance; sociology of sport, FairPlay and health behaviour change.",
        "Students then select 2 from 3 Practice in Context Modules within which to integrate and apply this knowledge in clinical case scenarios focussing on Sport Psychology elements. There is emphasis on using appropriate methods of ethical reasoning to arrive at balanced judgements and actions where complex and/or conflicting issues are involved."
