    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed to develop self-confidence in the student, exploring humour and their innate sense of fun, to creatively explore their everyday lives, satirise the world around them, subvert and poke fun at topical issues with an awareness of cultural, gender and ethical sensitivities, and develop skills from working professional comedians.",
        "Students will be guided in useful, productive ways to observe everyday people and ordinary encounters, and recreate them into seriously funny stories that connect with audiences. Beginning with raw material, such as a concept for a character or a situation, students will discover how to begin to transform it into a stand-up routine or into sketch comedy.",
        "Students will also be encouraged to think critically and analyse productively, reflecting on comic failure and success, as well as how best to employ changes of status and even slapstick, to their advantage. The subject will cover the fundamentals of physical comedy, improvisation, parody, character-building, absurd, nonsense and extreme humour, story structure and Lazzi.",
        "The subject is delivered through a combination of workshops, assigned readings, screenings and lectures."
