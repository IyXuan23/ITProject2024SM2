        "Students are taught to map out the structures and complex geometries within a series of multiply-deformed turbite sequence. The course teaches the concepts of key locality and provides strategies to correlate between key localities to produce consistent maps and cross-sections over outcrops at Bermagui Heads and Pt Dickinson in Bermagui in a structurally complex area within a poly-deformed terrane."
