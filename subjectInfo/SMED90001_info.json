    "overview": [
        "All students complete a foundation sports medicine theory & practice module Biomechanics and Sports Injury Prevention. Professional guidelines & regulations for safe participation in sports and exercise in various contexts are sourced and explored. Biomechanics and pathomechanics are analysed in a range of sports and exercise contexts, including walking & running, jumping & landing, throwing, and integrated sports-skill scenarios. There is emphasis on assessing load patterns and mechanics in athletic movements; and interpreting and predicting potential implications of pathomechanics on injury and performance. This entails both video and \u2018real time\u2019 analysis of athletes. The supporting evidence and practicalities of innovative and established approaches to measurement, reporting and clinical application in injury prevention strategies are considered. These include injury and illness surveillance, musculoskeletal profiling, load monitoring / management, environment assessment; and specific tools such as return to sport and concussion testing in minimising re-injury.",
        "",
        "Students then select 2 from 3 Clinical Practice in Context Modules within which to integrate and apply this knowledge to inform an evidence-based, prioritised approach to biomechanics and sports injury & illness prevention in sports medicine.",
        "",
        "Athlete Health Screening and Musculoskeletal Profiling: Comprehensive and best practice approaches to medical screening for safe participation in sport & exercise and musculoskeletal profiling are explored. The processes, practicalities, application and potential adaptations for case-context scenarios are evaluated.Exercise and Load \u2013 In specific case scenarios, measurement and evaluation of load and approaches to load management are explored at the level of the athlete, the sporting context, and training cycles. This includes systemic responses to training and overtraining.Injury Risk Management \u2013 Policy and Practice: In case-context scenarios, issues of injury risk minimisation and management are appraised from a policy and practice perspective. This includes risk assessment and management tools, venue design, procedures and participation at the population level.",
        "The final Integration, Contribution & Reflection Module provides opportunity to collaborate with other professionals to promote safe participation in sports and exercise for individuals of all ages and abilities in different sporting contexts. Based on the Context Modules, Experts and students share an element of evidence-based advice regarding the optimal activity or intervention for specific individuals and ways in which they can minimise risk of injury and promote health. This could include discussion of pertinent biomechanics or education to a population group or individual athlete."
