    "overview": [
        "This subject, which includes an intensive in-country component, will explore the history, politics and socio-cultural contexts of the French-speaking Pacific. The selected destination will vary. Typically, the in-country component will take place in New Caledonia or French Polynesia. Please contact the subject coordinator for more information. In the selected French Pacific region, students will be exposed to a diverse program of activities and numerous opportunities to interact with local institutions, artists and the local population to develop greater insights into the multiplicity of perspectives and identities in the chosen region. Challenges associated with sustainable development, health and globalisation will also be considered. The selected French Pacific region will also be examined through a series of lectures and workshops delivered on campus prior to departure. The subject will be conducted in French."
