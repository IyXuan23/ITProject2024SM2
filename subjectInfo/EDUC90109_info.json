        "This subject is a theoretical and practical exploration of the process of curriculum design across languages and across sectors (primary and secondary schools and adult contexts including tertiary and vocational education providers). Addressing the needs of multilingual and multicultural contexts of education, the subject uses socio-cultural and critical approaches to bring awareness to how language curriculum is constructed, developed, implemented and evaluated locally and globally (Australian/Victorian curriculum and internationally).",
        "Reflecting these frameworks, weekly topics depict beyond \u2018what\u2019 of curriculum to consider \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019, namely: socio-cultural perspectives to language curriculum, multi-literacies and multi-modality, needs analysis and situation analysis, dialogic approach in syllabus design and language curriculum in multilingual contexts, materials development and text selection, and assessment in/for/of curriculum.",
