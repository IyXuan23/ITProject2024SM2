        "The aim of this subject is to provide students with an understanding of the systematic processes involved in food research and product development. This subject represents a capstone experience for the food science major. It will allow students to experience and conduct basic research projects (minimum six weeks equivalent).",
        "It is anticipated that students will implement the knowledge they have gained via foundation and specialised studies through preparation of a research proposal, and executing that proposal in a laboratory or industry environment. The outcome will involve the development of a new food product, or solving a problem facing the food industry through knowledge of market research, product design and evaluation, packaging, safety, quality and regulatory requirements.",
