    "overview": [
        "The capacity to create and innovate is both a fundamental characteristic of human beings and the source of humankind's cultural and economic advancement. Being products of the human intellect (i.e. \u201cintellectual property\u201d), creations and innovations, and signifiers of reputation, are intangibles \u2013 which makes the transmission of them easy, and the prevention of their use by others hard. This subject is concerned with the law's response to the issues of whether, when, how and by whom creations, innovations and signifiers of reputation can be protected against unauthorised use. In particular, it explores the rationales for, and the operation of, the main intellectual property protection regimes \u2013 copyright, patent and trade mark laws \u2013 as they apply to the creative arts, the sciences and the business world.",
        "The principal topics covered are:",

        "When can a brand owner prevent a competitor from making a similar-named or similar- looking product?",
        "In what situations can a third party make use of another\u2019s intellectual property?"
