        "Students enrolled in this subject will partner with a host organization to complete an industry-based research project. Firms may be based in the commercial property development, investment, valuation, management and consultancy fields. Students will be supervised by the Subject Coordinator in collaboration with a designated party at the host organisation. Students will work on a research topic chosen by the host organization and will spend no more than 12 days working at the host organization over the course of the subject. Work will be limited to that needed to complete the research project. The Industry-Based Research Project will enable students to extend and apply the knowledge acquired through the Master of Property coursework subjects, will provide students with a valuable professional experience, and will extend their professional networks. This project can be taken to fulfil the research requirement of the Master\u2019s in Property and may replace ABPL90362 Research Thesis \u2013 Property"
