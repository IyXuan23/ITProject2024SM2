    "overview": [
        "The focus of this subject is to engage students in the process of making strategic and appropriate research design choices from the range of qualitative research methods suitable for social science research. The subject will move between gaining practical experience with in-depth interviewing as a core qualitative data collection technique, and understanding the sampling and recruitment strategies that frame data collection for qualitative research more generally. The elective is structured as an interactive workshop involving a mixture of lecture, discussion and practical activities. The elective will be most suited to those who have had some previous experience with qualitative research, though it is not essential."
