    "overview": [
        "On completion of this subject, students will demonstrate an advanced level of safe and effective delivery of clinical practice in an area of a professional speciality.  They will extend on existing knowledge and skills to an advanced level as a practitioner, communicator, collaborator, leader, health advocate, scholar and professional in this area. Teaching approaches will include critical observation of advanced practice and clinical practice in specialist clinics, working with a range of clients with complex conditions, critiques of video recordings of a range of clinical activity, observing specialist physiotherapists in practice, mentoring, role modelling  and providing feedback to peer physiotherapists. Students will develop advanced skills in assessment, diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic interventions, as well as engage with up to date, ethical and resource efficient practice, which they will critically evaluate. They will demonstrate an ability to create therapeutic alliances with clients and communicate outcomes effectively with relevant others, including those from other professions. They will employ multiple learning strategies to complete a Practice Portfolio that will show evidence of: highly developed clinical expertise as judged by senior clinicians; completion of online modules; mentoring and educating junior and peer clinicians; role modelling; advanced clinical reasoning and achievement of all learning outcomes set for the subject. Students will share their knowledge with their colleagues through engagement with discussion board and will be encouraged to present their learning to colleagues both locally and internationally.",
        "",
        "Students will have 6 months from the time of enrolment to complete all subject intended learning outcomes and assessment tasks, including a clinical examination to a satisfactory standard that demonstrates a high level of competency in their clinical practice."
