    "overview": [
        "Current advances worldwide in crop and pasture monitoring methods focus on innovative remote sensing and precision agriculture technologies to quantitatively assess crop physiological condition and soil properties for informed agronomic decisions.",
        "New developments in crop sensing, comprising innovative close range-, drone- and satellite-based technologies and models will be discussed in the context of physiology and agronomy, with emphasis on water stress detection for precision irrigation, crop nutrient assessment for site-specific fertilizer application, early disease detection, soil condition and management, crop quality parameter quantification, and improved within-field crop yield uniformity evaluation for sustainable crop production.",
        "New sensing methodologies available for monitoring physiological crop traits related to crop photosynthesis and transpiration via fluorescence emission detection will be described, linking to new tools required by industry in the context of high\u2011throughput data collection for plant phenotyping and plant breeding. Students will gain practical experience with laboratory and field physiological measurement techniques, remote sensing, precision agriculture tools and data analytical methods."
