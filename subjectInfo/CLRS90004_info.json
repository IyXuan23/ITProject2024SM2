        "This subject provides students with the opportunity to design and conduct, under supervision, an independent clinical research project. Students will take responsibility for all aspects of the research project including the experimental design and collection of research data;, appropriate statistical analysis, and interpretation of data; and oral and written presentations of the results. Upon completion of this subject, participants will produce an original research demonstrating an effective writing style and reflecting sound reasoning, clarity of thinking and compliance with style requirements. Undertaking this subject provides an opportunity for students to define a research question and identify an appropriate methodology, conduct research independently, and demonstrate critical thinking reflecting breadth and depth of knowledge in clinical research."
