    "overview": [
        "Students will consolidate their ability to communicate in German in oral and written discourse and develop cultural literacy in German by engaging with key themes in modern German-speaking societies such as the concept of \"kulturelle Werte\" and \"Jugendsprache\".Students will develop more advanced language skills through reading short newspaper and magazine articles and watching film and television clips. They will produce shorter texts of different types and learn how to discuss contemporary issues. Students will also gain an understanding of the principles of organizing language as well as developing proficiency in the use of the appropriate linguistic tools for the formation of situation-appropriate vocabulary, sentence and text structures. Through the cultural studies seminars students will be introduced to selected aspects of the literature, culture and linguistics of German-speaking countries. Students will become familiar with specialized terminology and will develop analytical skills relevant to the topic area."
