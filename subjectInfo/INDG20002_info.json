        "Internationally, Indigenous peoples and their knowledges are increasingly valued in the reimagining of human relationships to the environment. This is due in part by the pressures wrought by climate instability and ecological collapse. From government policy to local conservation managers, Indigenous ways of engaging with their environments is in demand. Our students will gain academic understanding of the deeply rooted traditions of knowledge, including Indigenous science, still maintained by Indigenous peoples worldwide, with particular focus on the Australian situation. It will examine current responses and how they might contribute to potential short, medium, long term threats and opportunities from Indigenous perspectives."
