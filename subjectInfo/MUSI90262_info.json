        "This subject examines contemporary perspectives on leadership in schools, analysing the structure, organisation and culture of secondary schools, their music department, and the impact of effective leadership on staff and student outcomes.",
        "Building on understandings of the role of teachers and relevant legislative, administrative, and organisational policies and processes regulating the profession, students will be introduced to the role of a leader and leadership at all levels in school settings.",
        "Students will reflect on developing self and others and explore notions of successful school leadership practices. The subject will explore concepts of engaging professionally with colleagues, maintaining, and cultivating connection and wellbeing to continually build professional skills and knowledge and critically reflect on pathways for professional learning and leadership development as graduates entering the profession. The subject critically examines leadership capacities in devising, developing, and sustaining instrumental music departments, and the diverse contexts where leadership manifests.",
        "This subject uses the Australian/Victorian Curricula and Frameworks. The assessments focus on professional engagement and development through a case study of a school and its music department, culminating in the creation of a professional learning plan to broaden teachers\u2019 knowledge and practice."
