        "This subject will explore a number of real-world ethical problems in international politics, and analyse the ethical responsibilities of citizens, states, and non-state actors in responding to these problems. These problems focus on ethical dilemmas concerning welfare, justice, and political legitimacy in relation to: political violence; world poverty and economic inequality; international governance; global gender inequalities; migration and refugee protection; environment; regulation of Multinational Corporations and NGOs; and international responses to human rights violations by states and Corporations. This subject will further familiarise students with a range of theories \u2013 in particular, \u2018consequentialist\u2019 and \u2018deontological\u2019 ethical theories, and normative political theories of \u2018justice\u2019, \u2018legitimacy\u2019, and \u2018human rights\u2019 \u2013 and help students to develop skills in applying these theories as tools for critical analysis of real-world ethical problems, and for prescribing ethical international institutions, policies, and political actions."
