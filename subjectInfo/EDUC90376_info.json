    "overview": [
        "This subject will develop and consolidate teacher candidates\u2019 understanding of major science concepts through an examination of children\u2019s everyday experiences. This development in science conceptual understandings will occur through the dynamic exploration of phenomena such as weather, motion and food, and understandings of students\u2019 motivations to learn science, and their curiosity about the natural world.",
        "This development in science conceptual understandings will occur through the dynamic exploration of phenomena such as weather, plants, motion and food, and align with, and contribute to, with students\u2019 interests and motivation to learn science. Candidates will develop pedagogical skills that support students to be curious about the natural world and create.",
        "Teacher Candidates will be introduced to key resources for science teaching in the form of activities, artefacts and digital technologies that will help them to plan for teaching science and technology concepts effectively in the classroom. They need to demonstrate that they can respond to the learning needs, curiosity and interests of primary students and design a sequence of learning experiences.",
        "Candidates will also be assisted to design, teach and evaluate a sequential unit of science that they have implemented. Candidates will become familiar with, and know how to utilise, the educational research that addresses science conceptual teaching challenges and appropriate pedagogical approaches that respond to the well - documented learning needs of primary aged students."
