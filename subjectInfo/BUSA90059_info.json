    "overview": [
        "Contemporary organisations are awash in data, whether it be about their customers, internal operating processes or financial activities. Harnessing this data allows managers to better understand their organisation, and thus make more informed decisions. This subject addresses fundamental data analytic skills necessary to extract information from data that then can be used to make better managerial decisions. In addition to becoming familiar with tools of quantitative analysis, students develop skills necessary for analytical thinking and a quantitative mind set. The fundamental analytical skills from this subject provide students frameworks for addressing managerial problems throughtout their careers."
