    "overview": [
        "This subject covers key concepts associated with the synthesis and design of organic and inorganic molecules, molecular architecture and the energy transformations associated with chemical and physical processes. Topics covered include synthesis of simple polyfunctional organic compounds, thermodynamically controlled reactions of s-, p- and d- block elements, thermodynamics, intermolecular forces and the electrical, optical and mechanical properties of solids. These topics have applications in drug discovery, chemical industry, nanotechnology, and energy harnessing through conventional and alternative energy sources."
