    "overview": [
        "In this subject each student will make a film using the \u201cunder camera animation\u201d technique. This animation technique involves the creation of an animation through frame-by-frame imagery, photographing each frame with a tablet and then combining these photographs into an animated film. The potential processes and materials that can be used to create these animations are broad, and may include drawing, erasure, paper cut-outs, found objects, clay, sand, or paint.Over the course of the subject students will be introduced to various techniques, materials and skills to create under camera animations. The craft and structure of animation will be considered, as will contemporary and historical under camera techniques, films and film-makers. Students will then apply these understandings and skills in order to develop and create their own \u201cunder camera\u201d animated film."
