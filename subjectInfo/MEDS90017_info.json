    "overview": [
        "Characteristics of educational leadership will be explored, including theories of leadership from business and management. These include trait, contingency and transformative theories. Originally introduced in subject 1, these concepts are explored in detail in relation to their application in surgical education. Teaching will explore similarities and differences between the contexts in which the theories were evolved and the landscape of surgical education. Students will also explore the conditions required for effective educational leadership.",
        "The subject will also consider ways in which leadership can be taught at all levels of medical and surgical education. As a surgical competency expected of all surgeons, there is currently little formal curricula activity to support acquisition of leadership in this profession.",
        "Students who aspire to senior educational roles, influencing local, state and national policy in medical and surgical education will be given the opportunity to consider strategies for lobbying government and other change activities.",
        "Centres of excellence in surgical education will be studied. Where are they? How did they emerge? We will study historical factors and trends in other professions to project future directions of surgical education.",
        "This subject is also designed to promote reflection on educational scholarship. What is it? How can it be achieved? How can it be sustained? We examine the learning environments we provide for surgical trainees. How can these be integrated into curriculum development",
        "The overall aims of this subject are:",
        "To appreciate the role of scholarship in surgical education",
        "To reflect on leadership and the ways in which it is (or is not) supported in medical and surgical curricula",
        "To consider characteristics of effective surgical education leaders",
        "To consider future directions for surgical education and training"
