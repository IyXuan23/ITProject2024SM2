        "This subject enables students to conduct an original research topic, under supervision approved by the subject coordinator. The work commitment will be equivalent to lecture and practical based subjects worth 25 points. The content and extent of the project will be determined by a project supervisor in consultation with the student and subject coordinator. Students are strongly encouraged to initiate project ideas within existing networks or to identify a project topic of keen interest, through discussion with subject coordinator, prior to subject commencement. The project represents a capstone subject and comprises a review of a body of relevant literature, together with a critical evaluation of research or experimental protocols, a modest original experiment, or limited exploration of a scientific problem, or an investigation into a problem using an approved methodology. Following an initial workshop to establish subject expectations, deliverables and skill base requirements, projects may involve regular one hour meetings with their supervisor where students report on progress, difficulties and research plans. Other workshops will deliver skill development in oral and written report presentation.",
        "Please note that students should enrol into both the Semester 1 and Semester 2 availabilities of this 12.5 subject to achieve the combined 25 point credit total."
