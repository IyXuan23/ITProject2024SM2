        "This is a subject for the background speakers of Chinese who have limited literacy in Chinese and for background speakers of English who have developed their skills in Chinese language. Students will develop their ability to communicate in Chinese at an advanced level and conduct discussion on a range of topics by engaging with the various social and cultural situations in Chinese society.",
        "Student expertise in the employment of both advanced linguistic and cultural resources is developed through reading relatively complex Chinese texts addressing each of these cultural situations, acquitting the literacies associated with these situations. The study of Chinese texts is supported by additional materials introducing the cultural topics. The texts\u2019 study is also supplemented by students\u2019 oral presentations and engaging in group discussions, as well as their conductions of written exercise."
