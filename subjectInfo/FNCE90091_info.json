        "The Thesis Workshop 1 and 2 involves a two-semester program of study, to be taken over two consecutive semesters, commencing in Semester 2. The preparation of the academic research paper is supported with each student allocated an advisor. Students will be required to conduct and present the results of this independent piece of finance research at the end of the second semester.",
        "This subject provides a substantive basis for progression to the doctoral program and serves as important preparation towards confirmation. Thesis Workshop 1 and 2 are intended to improve students\u2019 familiarity with the process of undertaking a research project \u2013 identifying the key research question, designing experiments, and formulating hypotheses \u2013 and to provide the opportunity for students to explore the literature relating to potential research topics. Accordingly, seminars and workshops will be held during the year to provide students with the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the various areas within the finance discipline while learning about the theoretical and empirical literature underlying current topics that faculty members are researching; discuss and critique current working papers; and discuss various aspects of the development of a research paper (i) motivation and literature review, (ii) hypothesis development, (iii) main results, and (iv) robustness test.",
        "The workshops also provide a forum for students to discuss and develop their own research proposal. All students are expected to attend these classes and familiarise themselves with any prescribed readings. All students are also expected to attend weekly seminars/workshops run in the Department of Finance."
