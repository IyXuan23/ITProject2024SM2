        "This subject brings students in the Musicology & Ethnomusicology Major together to craft, research, and present a semester-long project on a contemporary issue in music studies. The subject begins with an introduction to the issue, followed by student-led discussions on its background and problems of method and historiography.",
        "Students then undertake guided research individually and in small groups to address one aspect of this disciplinary question, applying insights and approaches acquired through previous musicology and ethnomusicology electives. The subject culminates in a final conference organised by students and the subject coordinator."
