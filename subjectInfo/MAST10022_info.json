    "overview": [
        "This subject covers the same material as MAST10007 Linear Algebra, but to a greater depth including a greater emphasis on mathematical rigour and proof.",
        "This subject gives a solid grounding in key areas of modern mathematics needed in science and technology. It develops the concept of a vector space, including linear transformations, matrices and the methods of linear algebra. There will be an emphasis on the axiomatic treatment of vector spaces, linear transformations, and inner product spaces.",
        "Students will develop the ability to use the methods of linear algebra and gain an appreciation of mathematical proof including the ability to prove results about vector spaces.",
        "Topics covered include: systems of linear equations; matrices and determinants; vectors in real n-space, cross product, lines and planes; general vector spaces; linear independence; bases and dimension; linear transformations; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; inner product spaces; symmetric and orthogonal matrices; diagonalisation of linear transformations and matrices."
