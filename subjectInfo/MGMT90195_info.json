Ways in which these theories are invoked and operationalised in empirical and conceptual studies will also be discussed. Some of the theories that will be covered include agency theory, resource-based view, transaction cost economics, resource dependence theory, innovation theory, entrepreneurship critical management theory and institutional theory. A strong emphasis will be placed on linking these theories to the various research topics in management."
