        "This subject provides students with the necessary skills to engage in a deep innovation investigation under the supervision of a member of the academic staff and in the context of industry engagement initiatives. Students working in groups use their computational knowledge to undertake customer inquiry, problem discovery, concept ideation and product validation for a real-world challenge. The digital innovation stream is taught by a combination of academics, industry experts and entrepreneurs, corporate executives, intellectual property attorneys and venture capitalists. As such, it provides a unique opportunity to gain real world experience while still in an academic environment."
