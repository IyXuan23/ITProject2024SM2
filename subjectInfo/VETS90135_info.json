    "overview": [
        "This subject continues the integrated and inter-disciplinary approach to the study of organ function and dysfunction in animals that was introduced in year one of the DVM course. Building on students\u2019 prior knowledge of body system function and dysfunction and their experience of scientific and clinical reasoning, this subject introduces students to the structure and normal functioning of the reproductive system, and to the principles of dysfunction of this system. Students will be introduced to the clinical disciplines of pharmacology and therapeutics, diagnostic imaging and clinical pathology as they relate to this system. Using case-based teaching approaches, they will apply their understanding of organ and system function and dysfunction to authentic situations that enhance the development of integrative clinical reasoning abilities, and the analysis of cases that involve multiple organ perturbation."

        "Utilise knowledge of the microscopic, developmental and gross anatomy of the male and female reproductive tracts in domestic animals to distinguish between normal and abnormal and to predict clinical outcomes of perturbations of this system, including during puberty, the oestrous cycle and pregnancy",
        "Discuss the structural and physiological changes of the female reproductive tract associated with the oestrous cycle, pregnancy, parturition and lactation and how they can be manipulated through veterinary interventions",
        "Apply knowledge of normal breeding, pregnancy, parturition and lactation to be able to identify and address reproductive problems in domestic animals including infertility, abortion, dystocia, and problems with lactation and neonatal animals",
        "Work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and apply an understanding of reproductive structure and function in order to analyse and interpret clinical problems related to this system in animals"
