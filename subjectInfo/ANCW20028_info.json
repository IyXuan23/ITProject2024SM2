    "overview": [
        "Artefacts (ceramics, metals, glass, coins etc.) are collected in great abundancy during archaeological fieldwork and constitute the most important source to obtain insight into the functioning and lifeways of past societies. Not only do they generally inform chronological frameworks, but they provide information on ancient trade and commerce; foodways; (cultural) identity and technological innovation.",
        "By focusing on the main civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean (and partially drawing on the Melbourne antiquities collection), this summer-intensive is a practical subject that introduces students to the interpretation possibilities of everyday items; acquaints them with different specialist fields that engage with ancient artefacts (archaeological conservation, museums), and teaches them essential skills (such as archaeological drawing and documentation and how to make their own ceramics!)."
