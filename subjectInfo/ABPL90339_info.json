    "overview": [
        "As the real estate market becomes increasingly international, it is necessary to understand how specific national markets operate and how they relate to one another within an international system. With globalisation, capital flows with increasing ease between national economies, and many real estate market actors - users, investors, developers and financiers - now search for opportunities across national boundaries. Real estate services, such as agency or research, have become international in order to serve these requirements.",
        "At the global level, the institutional environment of real estate is extremely diverse. There are wide national differences in the economic, political, social and legal contexts within which real estate markets operate. Variations in planning control, landlord and tenant law, methods of valuation, professional education, and the symbolic significance of landed property represent important examples, and there are many others. Real estate market analysis therefore has to translate between different systems, both literally in terms of working language and metaphorically in terms of differences in business practice and culture.",
        "This subject is intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of international real estate markets examining the rationale for their existence and development, its links to economic change, international financial diversification and institutional adaptation. The subject also examines the role of, and changes in, business culture to provide an understanding of the behaviour of real estate markets. The subject allows comparison over time of real estate markets in different countries, showing differences in market characteristics and changes thereof. The entry of international companies and their role in market development is also examined."
