        "The Group Project is a group research project, undertaken for an external organisation, with the aim of investigating and proposing a solution to a real problem or challenge for the organisation. The Group Project provides an opportunity for students to work in teams, to apply and extend their knowledge acquired in the EMA coursework modules, and to further their experiential learning in a specific professional context. Integral to this learning experience are team work, understanding the needs of the organisation and engaging with the organisation to define the problem to be solved, the scope of the project, and the nature of the final product. Students in the Group Project will be supervised by the Subject Coordinator in collaboration with a Designated Supervisor at the external host organisation. The student teams will have the opportunity to be co-located with the external organisation, to extend their professional networks, and to acquire appropriate professional work experience. Students will deliver the results of their project to the organisation in both written format and in a formal presentation. Students will also have the opportunity to reflect on their experience."
