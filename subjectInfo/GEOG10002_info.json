    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) providing an understanding of the use of software and the acquisition, storage and interpretation of spatial and temporal data associated with landscapes. The subject covers the application of GIS in a number of fields including physical and human geography, planning and natural resource management. Students are introduced to core concepts in GIS and analytical techniques including spatial sampling, interaction models, and spatial statistics. Students are also provided instruction in the presentation of spatial data."
