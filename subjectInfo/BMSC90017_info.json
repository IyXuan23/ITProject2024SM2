    "overview": [
        "The past decade has seen a growing interest in metabolism research which is reshaping our understanding of human physiology and disease, with the ultimate goal to aid in better treatment and prevention of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, cancer and related metabolic diseases. This subject will bring together some of the most outstanding metabolism researchers, with a strong translational focus, to introduce interested students to the innovative technologies utilised in the metabolism field in both academia and industry. This subject will provide theoretical and hands-on experience in state-of-the-art innovative technologies for discovery and translational metabolism research, including measures of glycaemia, mass spectrometry-based approaches, as well as gene/protein therapy and pharmaceutical interventions.",
