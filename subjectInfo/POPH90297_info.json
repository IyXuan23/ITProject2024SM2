    "overview": [
        "Violence against women is a major public health and human rights issue and is highly prevalent globally. Prevention of violence against women is an important policy priority for governments around the world, as demonstrated through its specific inclusion in Sustainable Development Goals targets and increasing commitments to evidence-based prevention interventions. Students in this subject will engage with evidence about the impact of violence against women; the causes of and contributors to violence against women; theories of social change; and prevention science and frameworks. Students will be introduced to the principles underpinning intersectional analysis and the co-design of interventions, and the particular ethical and safety issues that arise when conducting research and evaluation in relation to violence against women and its prevention. This subject will be of value to students from public health as well as from many other sectors working towards the prevention of violence against women."
