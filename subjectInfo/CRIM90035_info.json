    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces students to the field of victimology. Victims have long had an ambiguous role in law. Liberal legal systems operate on the principle that crimes are committed against the state. However, victims are often required to narrate their victimisation to assist in the adjudication of guilt. This sidelines many, with paradoxical effects. Participating in legal proceedings can be cathartic for some, whereas for others it may be traumatic and re-victimising. In part because of this, many victims now seek justice beyond traditional legal processes.",
        "In this subject, students will be introduced to critical issues associated with the status of victims. Part one of the subject investigates the degree to which traditional criminal justice processes can better accommodate the needs of victims. Part two explores recognition and redress for victims beyond formal law. The subject will examine:",
        "The historical context of victimology, and the rise of victim\u2019s rights",
        "Policy and process reforms to enhance inclusion in formal legal processes",
        "Forms of recognition and redress that have arisen outside of traditional legal processes",
        "Future directions in victim-centred justice.",
        "Students will engage with a range of contemporary issues concerning victims, and will debate the possibilities and limitations of formal law in meeting victims\u2019 complex needs. Please note that the subject incorporates institutional child sexual abuse as a case-study and may be distressing. It includes an off campus visit as part of the intensive."
