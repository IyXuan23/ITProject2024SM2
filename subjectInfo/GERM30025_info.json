        "This subject is the capstone for all students completing a major in German Studies, regardless of entry level. In this subject, students extend and apply their learning in German language and cultural studies to a real-world context: the staging of a student theatre production in German, for an internal and external audience. Students will engage with the history of German-language theatre and will gain in-depth knowledge of one play, including its historical context, performance history and generic features. Students will work with a high degree of independence in regard to the interpretation and staging of the play. They will use their skills in German language and literary interpretation to research the play, its context and content."
