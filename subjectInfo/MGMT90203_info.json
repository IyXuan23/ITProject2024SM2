        "This subject is aimed at students undertaking graduate research programs. The overall aim is to introduce students to core quantitative methods and techniques commonly used in management and marketing research. It provides students with a working knowledge of the spectrum of alternative techniques for collecting and analysing data. Whilst this subject will not provide the depth required of a specialist in any particular technique, by the end of this subject, students will have a working knowledge of the foundations of descriptive and inferential statistics, with a focus on applying ANOVA, MANOVA and regression analysis."
