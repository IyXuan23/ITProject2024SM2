    "overview": [
        "Why do we fall for visual illusions? How can we use the speed of our responses to tell us about the construction of the brain and the mind? How do we remember? How does the detection of noisy signals inform our understanding of faulty eyewitness memory? Are fingerprint experts better than novices at matching patterns? Perception, Memory and Cognition will cover a series of robust, valuable, and enduring findings illustrating the accumulation of knowledge through experimentation and theory development. From historical studies of response time and perceptual processes through to modern tests of applied decision making, you will learn how theories are tested, discarded, and revised in light of careful experimental evidence. We will discuss a variety of cognitive processes, from the initial stages of stimulus perception all the way through to decision making. The tutorial stream will provide an opportunity for students to develop an understanding of experimental techniques and scientific writing skills as they apply to forensic psychology."
