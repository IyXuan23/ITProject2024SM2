        "The Honours program in the Department of Clinical Pathology provides an introduction to the challenging area of investigation of disease processes at the cellular and molecular level. This program involves candidates undertaking a full-time research project based in a laboratory within the Department of Clinical Pathology or at one of our affiliated institutions. A student undertaking the Pathology Honours Research Project will have an interest in understanding the mechanisms of disease.",
        "This subject is delivered in two consecutive parts. Whilst these have separate subject codes, they are considered to be a single continuing subject of 75 credit points. At the end of the first part, students will receive a CNT (Continuing \u2013 ongoing) grade. At the completion of the second part, students will receive an overall result for the subject.",
