    "overview": [
        "This is a geotechnical engineering subject in which students will be introduced to various geotechnical engineering application topics, including the design of pile foundations, tunnels and earth dams, basics of rock mechanics, rock slope stability assessment and site characterisation.  This subject is of particular interest to students intending to establish a career in geotechnical engineering; it is also relevant to a range of engineering disciplines in which a good knowledge of geotechnical engineering offers an advantage, such as structural engineering.",
        "The subject covers pile foundations \u2013 Various pile types available in the construction field and their installation and load bearing mechanisms, design of a single pile and a pile group with considering the bearing capacity and settlement failures, rock socketed piles, laterally loaded piles, micro piles and ground improvement techniques for piling; Basic rock mechanics \u2013 Rock stresses and strength, rock failure principles, rock testing; Rock slope assessment \u2013 Apply the theories of rock mechanics on slope stability assessment; Site characterisation for foundations \u2013 Planning and implementation of a site investigation; Tunneling- Key factors in tunnel design and design processes; Earth dam design \u2013 Different types of earth Dams and their functions, key design concepts."
