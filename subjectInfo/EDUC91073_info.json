    "overview": [
        "This subject provides an orientation to teaching mathematics in Victorian primary schools. Teacher Candidates will develop mathematical content knowledge and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge for the effective teaching and learning of Number and Algebra using the four proficiency strands from the Australian/Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks and Curricula. Teacher Candidates will analyse the development of key concepts in primary mathematics and identify critical progression points for children\u2019s learning. They will consider children\u2019s conceptual development of Number and Algebra constructs.",
        "Teacher Candidates will be introduced to assessment tools for children\u2019s understanding to improve school students\u2019 learning in the content strand Number and Algebra. Teacher Candidates will reference Victorian and Australian curriculum documents and resources when lesson planning, administering classroom assessment and implementing effective teaching strategies. Teacher Candidates will consider important pedagogical issues such as: use of resources, models of mathematical concepts, as well as explicit teaching and questioning. Teacher Candidates will explore how to differentiate in the mathematics classroom and engage in the Clinical Teaching Model to target teaching to differing needs of students."
