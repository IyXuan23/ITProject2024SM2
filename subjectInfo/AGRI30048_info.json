    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on understanding the procedures involved in breeding crops and the role of genetics in the process.The integration of conventional breeding approaches and the use of gene technologies in breeding new crop varieties are explored. Emphasis is placed on how plant breeders identify priority traits and the management of breeding programs in a commercial setting. The practical sessions aim to develop skills in plant breeding methodologies and research techniques.",
