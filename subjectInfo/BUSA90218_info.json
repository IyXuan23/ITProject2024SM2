        "During the week-long intensive subject, students will be introduced to a number of techniques and concepts covering (1) individual creativity and brainstorming, (2) team creativity, (3) innovation within small and large firms, and (4) linking ideas from the subject to other subjects including strategy, marketing and operations.The subject will be a hands-on experiential subject, with a focus on a real-world project to help the students acquire practical skills. It is not a \"theory\" subject.",
        "We want our students to think outside the box, regardless of whether they become entrepreneurs, to be creative and inventive within their job scopes, whether they decide to start entrepreneurial firms later on, or if they join existing firms. Such skills are becoming more important to employers as many industries face rapidly changing market conditions and innovative global competitors"
