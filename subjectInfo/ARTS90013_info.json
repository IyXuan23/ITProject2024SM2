    "overview": [
        "This workshop series will examine media culture(s), focusing on how the social sciences and Humanities deal with culture, including cultural production, forms and practices, across the axes of time and space, and incorporating both the virtual and the material dimensions. Together we will examine uneasy tensions in the hermeneutics of culture; from the expanded terrains of mediated, transnational culture, as discussed by different theorists of the twentieth and twenty-first century, such as Raymond Williams, David Harvey, and Theodor Adorno. The range of topics covered during the semester will be framed from the micro- to the macro-level perspective and back, and may include concepts of the everyday, the functions of technology, and the effects of global communication networks and so on."
