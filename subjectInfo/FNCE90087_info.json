        "Sustainability is an increasingly important consideration in the finance sector. This subject will examine how Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks, including climate change and human rights, can be integrated into investment decisions and ongoing management. Topics will include: how investors vote and actively engage with investee companies to ensure long-term value creation, ethical investing, social activist divestment campaigns and financial market innovations to address sustainability objectives. This subject will also outline why, how and where investment is used to intentionally drive social and environmental impact in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Topics will include: a practical overview of best practice in strategically managing impact, embedding impact considerations into all elements of fund management, and how various elements of global and national financial systems help and hinder the flow of capital to impact."
