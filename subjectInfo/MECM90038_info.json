    "overview": [
        "Students will be introduced to a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches to researching communications, institutions, technologies, texts and audiences across the complex digital global media landscape. Students will gain practical experience in applying different research methods and data gathering processes, including techniques for semi-structured interviews, content analysis, semiotics, discourse analysis, ethnography, surveys and social media analysis. Students will learn how to conduct a literature review, develop a research question, design a research methodology, identify and collect a data sample, manage and analyse data, and present the findings through the execution of their own research project. Upon completion of the subject, students will have developed an understanding of the key issues, strategies, and ethical responsibilities of media and communications research. To this end, students have the opportunity to develop special insight and expertise into an area of media and communications practice. The subject provides students with critical research skills for application to both industry and scholarly research projects, and equips them for further research subjects offered in the Masters of Global Media program."
