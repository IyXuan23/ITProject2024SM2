This subject enables participants to draw on the expertise developed throughout the MSP and apply it in real time to a contemporary project. The project is team-based to mirror the practical experience of managers and will be developed and overseen by both a professional and academic mentor. The project team will work in consultation with their practice and academic mentors to develop a project brief, undertake analysis, and prepare a professional report to the sponsoring organisation. The project team will present their report at the Capstone Presentation Day."
