        "Understanding human behaviour is a major challenge and a crucial step in solving many of the world\u2019s most wicked problems. As access to computational power has grown and data sources have expanded computational modelling methods have become essential to progress in understanding cognitive and social processes. This course covers topics in perception, memory, language, reasoning, social structure and influence from a computational modelling perspective. For computer scientists, it illustrates how computational approaches can be used to capture and explain human behaviour. For behavioural scientists, it provides the skill set required to develop computational theories of cognition and social behaviour and to exploit new and emerging sources of digital data."
