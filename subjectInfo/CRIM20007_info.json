    "overview": [
        "Whilst mobile and social media benefit society in many ways, they have also given rise to a range of cybercrimes and online harms. In this subject we examine the origins, nature, and prevalence of a range of cybercrimes and online harms. Further, through considering cybercrimes in the context of recent debates within criminology, sociology, media studies and software studies, we consider the unique challenges of preventing and regulating these online forms of harm. Finally, we look at the opportunities the Internet provides for responding to crimes, through addressing how victims of crime have sought justice through social media and online activism. Topics covered in the course include hacking, revenge porn, online abuse, phishing, antisocial media, and illicit drug distribution through dark net cryptomarkets."
