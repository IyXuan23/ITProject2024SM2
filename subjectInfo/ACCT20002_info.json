        "This subject focuses on more advanced external financial reporting obligations applicable to entities within the framework of the Australian reporting environment. In particular, it examines key technical Accounting Standards integral to the preparation of general purpose financial statements by reporting entities. It also considers the theories that help explain why financial accounting exists as well as what motivates and affects the judgements of managers when making financial accounting reporting decisions. Finally, it critically reviews important contemporary accounting issues affecting the business community under consideration by accounting standard setters."
