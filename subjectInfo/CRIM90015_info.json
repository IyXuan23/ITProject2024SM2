    "overview": [
        "This subject considers and compares responses to \u2018terrorism\u2019 in selected global contexts. Of particular interest are legal responses, instigations of war, and the aftermath of war, practices of rendition, arbitrary detention and torture, together with the emergence of nationalist counter-terror narratives. Many of these responses have been argued to contravene due process and the presumption of innocence and to contribute to civil and global unrest, creating new categories of what it means to be criminal. In examining these concerns, the subject also considers the emergence of far-right extremist violence as a terrorist /counter terror response. The subject draws upon the conceptual and analytical tools of criminological and socio-legal examination including analysis of the political, social and legal construction of terror and terrorism, and of \u2018terrorist\u2019 actors. It also undertakes a close examination of the inspiration for counter-terrorism initiatives, conflicting arguments about their necessity and the (side) effects they have generated."
