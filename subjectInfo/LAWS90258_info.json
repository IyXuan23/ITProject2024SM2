        "The Executive Branch Research Lab aims to foster innovative, practice-led JD legal research into the largest and most elusive branch of the constitutional order: the executive. Against a background of tuition in core concepts and practices relevant to study of the contemporary executive branch \u2013 including the political philosophies of the \u2018welfare state\u2019 and \u2018neoliberalism\u2019, the centrality of contracting to contemporary governmental practice, and how to understand the ideal of the rule of law in relation to different executive branch activities \u2013 the Research Lab will support enrolled students to acquire the academic and practical skills needed to pursue research on and analysis of the contemporary executive branch \u2018in action\u2019. Engaging closely with participating faculty, and working together on group projects, enrolled students will receive training to undertake such activities as making submissions to current parliamentary and law reform inquiries, writing blog entries on issues arising from current executive branch practices for the Research Lab\u2019s dedicated website, conducting interviews with present and former \u2018frontline\u2019 executive branch actors with a view to intergenerational dialogue and learning, and participating in ongoing (year-to-year) research projects convened under the auspices of the Research Lab.",
