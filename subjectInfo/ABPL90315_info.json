    "overview": [
        "Urban governance and citizen participation influence both the structure of the planning process (e.g. who participates, and how and when they participate) and the built environment outcomes produced from this process. All practitioners who work in local and regional environments (built, natural, social) need to be aware of the strategies and techniques that can be employed to elicit involvement from the public and private sector, and the modes of governance that shape citizen and stakeholder participation at different scales of government and at different points in the planning process.  This subject will impart to students the skills involved in encouraging and managing participation in the overall governance and planning of urban regions.",
        "These skills include:",
        "Understand the concept of urban governance",
        "Understanding the influence of different forms of urban governance on processes of citizen participation",
        "Understand the nexus between the public and private sectors and civil society in planning for and managing cities",
        "Understand the role of local, State and Commonwealth government, the private sector and civil society in delivering and financing infrastructure and services",
        "Encouraging and managing citizen engagement using different participatory tools",
        "Understanding and assessing different characteristics of urban conflict",
        "Negotiation, mediation, consensus-building between government, the private sector and civil society in complex situations with deep value differences",
