        "Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. The course is designed to be relevant to the broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by the manager and professional, often in a global context.",
        "A basic premise of the course is that while a manager needs analytical skills to discover optimal solutions to problems, a broad array of negotiation skills is needed in order for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course will give you the opportunity to develop these skills experientially and to understand negotiation in useful analytical frameworks."
