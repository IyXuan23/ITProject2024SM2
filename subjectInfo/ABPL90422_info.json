        "SI_ Lab: Spatial Informationis part of the  Digital Design and Fabrication Electives, which offer students the opportunity to build and demonstrate expertise and competence in the understanding and application of contemporary design tools that inform and shape students\u2019 design process and thinking. Digital Design and Fabrication Electives are based on a culture of experimenting and making \u2013 applying contemporary design and making tools to create advanced physical and digital artefacts and environments.For more detailed information concerning the respective tutors, design approaches and previous examples as well as other offerings in the Digital Design and Fabrication Electives suite please check on the ADD+F Research Hub website under teaching and learning:https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/addf",

        "SI_Labintroduces students to critical engagement with 3D scanning and virtual reality technologies for the creation, reproduction and representation of spatial environments and novel artefacts.Students gain knowledge and develop skills in immersive digital technologies, geometry, media and theory.InSI_Labstudents are introduced to various image making technologies, ranging from 3D-scanning, photography and film, to the use of real-time render engines and Virtual Reality systems, exploring questions of architectural reproduction and representation. While applying new representational technologies students demonstrate a critical understanding and reflection as well as the ability to apply these technologies in a conceptual and designerly manner.",
        "",
        "Key architectural sites, situations and events will be chosen to scan, analyse and represent using high resolution 3D point cloud data. Specific training will be provided to develop skills in the analysis and representation of the digital data, with student projects culminating in projects that range from the design of novel representations to virtual reality experiences, generated using real-time rendering engines, to generate innovative tectonic, aesthetic and spatial configurations.",
