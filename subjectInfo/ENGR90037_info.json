    "overview": [
        "The subject involves undertaking a substantial group project (typically in groups of three students) requiring an independent investigation on an approved topic in advanced engineering design and / or research. Each project is carried out under the supervision of a member of academic staff and where appropriate an industry partner.",
        "The emphasis of the project can be associated with either:",
        "A well-defined project description, often based on a task required by an external, industrial client. Students will be tutored in the synthesis of practical solutions to complex technical problems within a structured working environment, as if they were professional engineering practitioners; or",
        "A project description that will require an explorative approach, where students will pursue outcomes associated with new knowledge or understanding, within the engineering science disciplines, often as an adjunct to existing academic research initiatives.",
        "It is expected that the Capstone Project will incorporate findings associated with both well-defined professional practice and research principles and will provide students with the opportunity to integrate technical knowledge and generic skills gained in earlier years.",
        "The project component of this subject is supplemented by a lecture course dealing with project management tools and practices.",
        "Please note:",
        "Students enrolled in the suite of Master of Engineering programs must be within the final 112.5 points of their degree to enrol.",
        "Students enrolled in the Master of Industrial Engineering must be within the final 100 points of their degree to enrol.",
        "Students are to take Engineering Capstone Project Part 1 and then subsequently continue with Engineering Capstone Project Part 2 in the following semester. Upon successful completion of this project, students will receive 25 points credit."
