        "Students undertake an original investigation of a topic relevant to Information Systems (or cognate discipline). Specific research projects will depend on the availability of appropriate expertise but may address a range of issues within Information Systems research.",
        "IS MAJOR Research Project",
        "Under the supervision and guidance of an academic researcher, students are required to design and conduct a research investigation. This would typically involve conducting a literature review to identify a research question, selecting an appropriate data gathering method to address this question, executing data collection, analysing data, and evaluating the outcome of the study both in terms of its limitations and against the existing literature. A systematic literature review would not usually be considered sufficient for this type of project. The results will be reported as a thesis and in a public presentation. In some instances, it is expected that the results will also be submitted for publication in a conference or journal. Students would normally undertake Information Systems Project Part 1 in their first semester of research and then the other 3 Information Systems Research subjects Part 2, 3, and 4 concurrently in the second semester of research."
