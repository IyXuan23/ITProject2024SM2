        "This subject focuses on the theoretical frameworks and evidence bases that educators use in understanding the development of their learners and in planning suitable instructional sequences that are responsive to the inherent variability of learners. It covers foundational concepts related to learning environments, learning processes and development across individual\u2019s lifespans. It also provides opportunities to explore and discuss implications for teaching that are related to the consideration of learners\u2019 profiles of capabilities and how teachers facilitate the quality, depth and active nature of their learning."
