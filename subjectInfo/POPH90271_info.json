    "overview": [
        "Faced with the rising cost of vaccines and increasing drug resistance, public health decision makers increasingly rely on epidemiological models of infectious disease transmission to predict the impact, and define optimal implementation of, intervention strategies. Such considerations are particularly critical in resource-constrained settings.",
        "This subject introduces students to the concepts of infectious diseases modelling required to interpret modelling papers relevant to the public health context. By considering real world examples of the use of models to support practice, they will learn to distinguish between different types of modelling frameworks, and understand their relevance to alternative questions and settings. Building on their strengths in infectious diseases epidemiology, students will develop confidence in assessing whether model frameworks incorporate all relevant knowledge and are \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 to support decision making."
