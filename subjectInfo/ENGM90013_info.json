    "overview": [
        "In fiercely competitive global and dynamic environments, companies face increasing pressures to exceed customer expectations along multiple performance measures, such as cost, quality, flexibility and innovativeness. To outperform their competitors, many firms make the mistake of mimicking their rivals, rather than focusing on developing the organizational capabilities that competitors will find difficult to match over the long term. And although operations are at the core of a firm\u2019s value adding activities, few firms have sought to build a sustainable competitive advantage around these capabilities.",
        "As such, this subject emphasises the critical nature of Operations Management as an essential part of a competent engineer\u2019s portfolio of knowledge and skills. Operations deals with the design, management and continuous improvement of business processes. It aims at providing some of the core concepts in operations that are essential for leveraging a firm\u2019s operational capabilities to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. This course provides a logical and rigorous approach to plan and control process structure and managerial levers to achieve desired business process performance."
