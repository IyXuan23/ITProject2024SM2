    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed as a comparative study across key Asian jurisdictions, and arranged around a number of distinct contract law problems. We will survey and apply Asian contract law critically and creatively. The subject places particular emphasis on legal solutions provided by Asian courts to practical problems arising in real life.",
        "In this subject, students are asked to think critically and beyond national barriers about the \u2018law as applied\u2019 and to investigate its structures, principles, policies, and values. It aims, as far as possible, to equip\u202fstudents with a deeper understanding of how contract law works \u2018in action\u2019 and the fundamentally distinct philosophies (for example Confucianism), policies, methodologies and legal techniques used by Asian jurists, compared to those favoured by their common law (English or Australian) counterparts. It also aims to help students to make better and more creative use of relevant legal resources to frame effective arguments.",
        "To achieve these aims, we will adopt a distinctly problem-oriented approach by focusing on the law as applied by courts and its jurisprudential basis. Students will be provided a reading list, carefully selected and arranged materials, including statutes (including Civil Code and, in the case of Chinese mainland, judicial interpretations issued by the Supreme People\u2019s Court), cases (such as Guiding Cases issued by the SPC) and secondary materials (all made available in English), a list of questions for discussion in each seminar and one or more case/problem scenario for in-depth investigation in class.",
        "Principal topics will include:",
        "Concept, function, history and fundamental principles of Asian contract law;",
        "Contract negotiation and procedural fairness, including pre-contractual liability (Culpa in contrahendo);",
        "Contract formation and bargain, including offer and acceptance;",
        "Mistake and unfair terms;",
        "Contract terms and interpretation;",
        "Termination of contract for non-performance or a supervening event;",
        "Remedies for breach of contract;",
        "Third party rights/obligations;",
        "Contract-related unjustified/unjust enrichment."
