        "This subject assesses and evaluates plant pests and diseases, which are the key biological factors impacting on plant health in urban landscapes. Students will learn how to assess and identify common pest and disease species; be able to describe the symptoms; and learn how and when to control and manage them in various settings. Maintaining the health of plants will also be approached from different perspectives such as various Integrated Pest Management methodologies. Students will explore industry-specific plant health issues relevant to trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. Safe and effective practices when using chemicals will be discussed, including the relevant legislation relating to chemicals, pests and diseases. The subject will be delivered through attendance at a six-day intensive workshop and a subsequent 10-12 week period of on-line subject delivery and assessment."
