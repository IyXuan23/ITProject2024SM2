    "overview": [
        "Delivered intensively, this subject investigates how design can be used to bring greater meaning, depth and emotion to stories told through the medium of film.",
        "We consider how design works by looking at visual language, colour theory, composition and metaphor. The role of the Production Designer will be outlined and the motivating factors behind the decisions they make will be identified. Students will be introduced to the processes designers use to generate ideas and then develop them into detailed design concepts.",
        "This subject will also focus on some of the ways in which these design concepts are realised. You will learn about the various roles within the Art Department as well as the nature of how a Production Designer collaborates with other key creative personnel, including the Director and Cinematographer."
