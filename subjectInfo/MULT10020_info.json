    "overview": [
        "This subject draws on history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology to explore the traditional contexts and contemporary application of mindfulness, meditation and other contemplative practices to day-to-day life. There will be an emphasis on evidence and rationale for the validity (or otherwise) of such practices to achieve individual and societal goals. The subject will integrate 1st person (experiential), 2nd person (intersubjective) and 3rd person (objective) forms of inquiry. This approach will help students build an integrated understanding of contemplative practices and their place in 21st Century existence.",
        "Students will develop critical insight into the history and contemporary practice of meditation, and what we know about certain implementations (e.g. ritual practice, smartphone apps, online programs, healthcare-based courses). We will also raise important ethical questions about where and when such practices may or may not be appropriate (e.g. schools, business, military) and the diverse and potentially contradictory aims held by individuals, organisations and traditions in relation to them. Partnered with direct practice in types of meditation from varying religious and secular traditions, students will gain both academic and practical insight into how contemplative practices work and what they can and cannot offer."
