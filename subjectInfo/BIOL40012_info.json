    "overview": [
        "This course is designed for students who want to gain experience in medical research but who are not enrolled in a medical degree. A particularly attractive aspect of the program is each project addresses a research problem directly relevant to human disease. A very wide range of projects is offered by leading research experts in laboratories belonging to this academic centre (University of Melbourne. Departments of Medicine based at the Royal Melbourne and Western Hospitals, Departments of Radiology, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Psychiatry and Surgery along with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Florey Neuroscience Institute. There are also projects with the CSIRO and NARI (National Ageing Research Unit). We have expertise in state-of-the-art basic, applied and clinical methodologies and offer a unique experience to Honours students. Not only do students master the research field of their project, but they have the opportunity to learn about the bigger picture, particularly with regard to leadership and responsibility, and the importance of the interface between research and clinical medicine. The research project is complemented by a seminar series dealing with \u201ctranslational medicine\u201d which is research that aims to turn scientific discoveries into practical treatments or interventions to improve human health and relieve suffering. All of the projects offer the opportunity of progression on to higher degrees including a PhD."
