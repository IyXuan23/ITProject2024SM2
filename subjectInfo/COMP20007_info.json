        "Programmers can choose between several representations of data. These will have different strengths and weaknesses, and each will require its own set of algorithms. This subject will cover some of the most frequently used data structures and their associated algorithms. The emphasis will be on justification of algorithm correctness, on analysis of algorithm performance, and on choosing the right data structure for the problem at hand."

        "Sample projects are: approximate string matching for a translation memory, involving sorting and comparison of dynamic programming, branch-and-bound search and brute-force search using a variety of data structures (e.g. arrays, hash tables, tries); speech synthesis based on a pronouncing dictionary and pre-prepared grapheme-phoneme alignment data, based on parsing of the alignment data, hashing of variable length n-grams, and a variety of models for predicting the phoneme(s) associated with a given phoneme sequence (e.g. a simple unigram baseline or a hidden Markov model).",

            "The subject provides students with intermediate-level, multi-module programming experience in C, and hands-on practicum with algorithmic analysis and development. It is highly relevant to any career involving \u201cbig data\u201d, and covers the staple of technical interviews by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon. There is every expectation that the subject will incorporate guest lecture(s) from leading figures in algorithmics."
