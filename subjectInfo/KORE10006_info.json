        "Korean 6 is suitable for students who have successfully completed Korean 5 or who possess an equivalent level of Korean language proficiency. This subject prepares students to engage in formal and informal settings in Korean. It trains students to communicate on a wide range of topics in history and society. Students will refine their communication skills on discipline-specific vocabulary and functionality. Students will also broaden the grammatical understanding of Sino-Korean idioms and technical terminology for academic performance. Through class activities, students will learn to use various forms of multimedia and field-specific texts to grasp the specialisation of language function. In addition, students will develop interpersonal skills and cultural awareness to understand others and to present themselves appropriately in cross-cultural situations."
