        "The focus of this subject lies in the integration of services and energy efficient strategies into the fabric of the building and its construction process. After introductory material on environmental quality and energy related issues, the subject provides students with knowledge in the field of electrical, mechanical, air handling, hydraulic and communication services and particularly the construction issues they generate: levels of documentation and decision-making required; connections with process planning; spatial requirements for functioning, installation and access purposes; protection and quality assurance; building tolerances; systems integration; layout strategies; work sequences and temporary works; contract coordination; testing; maintenance; and upgrading-replacement.",
