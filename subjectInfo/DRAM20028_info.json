        "This subject focuses on classical texts such as Shakespeare and Chekhov with the exploration of performance style to inhabit and serve the world of the play and the voice of the writer. Working within an ensemble, actors will explore historical, emerging, collaborative and mediated theatrical paradigms through practical exploration of extant text in a variety of studio contexts.",
        "Students begin to apply acting methodology to training exercises and interpretive rehearsal processes. Intensive character and text work provide opportunities for the integration of physical, vocal and character development techniques into rehearsal and preparation for performance. Students begin to understand the requirements of a rehearsal process and appropriate professional practice.",
        "In applying technical skills to rehearsal and performance tasks, students develop integrated acting, vocal and physical technique."
