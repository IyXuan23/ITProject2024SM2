        "This practice-based drawing subject focuses on developing skills and techniques in figurative drawing. It is designed for students who have little or no experience in visual art making.",
        "Students will be introduced to specialist figurative drawing techniques through working from both life models and from anatomical specimens within the Harry Brookes Allen Museum of Anatomy and Pathology in the Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience.",
        "Lectures and writing tasks that explore the human figure in historic and contemporary visual art will complement the drawing program. By the end of the subject, students will have developed a comprehensive folio of exercises and finished works exploring the body in both its living and preserved states, highlighting the ways in which artistic practice can be used to examine these conditions.",
