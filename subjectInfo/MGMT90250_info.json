    "overview": [
        "Students undertake an original investigation of a topic relevant to analytics and its application. Under the supervision and guidance of an academic researcher, students are required to design and conduct a practice-oriented investigation. This would typically involve a literature review, data collection, data analysis and critical reflection of real-world practice. The results will be reported as a thesis and in a public presentation. In some instances, it is expected that the results will also be submitted for publication in a conference or journal.",
        "The project will require an explorative approach, where students will pursue outcomes associated with new knowledge or understanding, within the analytics disciplines, often as an adjunct to existing academic research initiatives. It is expected that the Capstone Project will incorporate findings associated with both well-defined professional practice and research principles.",
        "Research will be conducted on a topic of mutual interest under the guidance of an experienced researcher."
