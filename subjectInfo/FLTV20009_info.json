        "Screen Practice 2B enables students to consolidate and further develop skills attained in Screen Practice 2A through making screen work of greater complexity.",
        "Students experience more substantial pre-production work, more sustained production periods and progress to more advanced work on the direction of performance. Practical assignments are completed within a staggered production schedule.",
        "Students will write and produce a short motion picture production, from concept to completion, finished to industry standard. Students also crew on other student productions in key areas, including camera, lighting, sound recording, production management, and assistant directing. Through collaboration with peers, within an interdisciplinary framework, students continue to develop and refine leadership and interpersonal skills."
