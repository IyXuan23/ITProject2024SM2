    "overview": [
        "The subject is structured to build upon students\u2019 understanding of the basic principles behind the development and function of the nervous system, developed in the prerequisite neuroscience subject/s. It will extend upon students\u2019 understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the peripheral and central auditory systems, including aspects of balance function, speech production and development of the inner ear. Following these core lectures, students\u2019 will be exposed to the applications of this knowledge to addressing pathologies of the auditory system, including relevant lectures from international leaders in cochlear implant research, emerging gene- and cell-based therapies, drug delivery platforms, auditory cortical plasticity and artificial hearing and voice."
