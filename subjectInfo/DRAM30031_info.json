        "Students refine their capacity to excel in stage and screen production processes via the sophisticated development, rehearsal, performance and evaluation of executed material.",
        "Through training tasks and exercises, students develop their ability to apply advanced acting, vocal and physical skills as an integrated performer. Students finalise their own training methodology established over three years of intense training exercises and interpretive rehearsal processes."
