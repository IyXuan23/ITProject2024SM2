        "The subject comprises a series of advanced lectures, delivered in research seminar format with accompanying readings, each focussing on a key area of critical care research. The aim is to provide students with a comprehensive knowledge base, using a pragmatic approach, that can be applied to both research and clinical care. Lectures cover research methodology and the latest translational research across the three key critical care disciplines of anaesthesia, emergency medicine and intensive care medicine, with topics ranging from clinical trial design, meta analysis, sepsis, delirium and perioperative risk through to toxicology, substance abuse and recreational drug related behaviour."
