    "overview": [
        "The overall aim of Principles of Clinical Practice 3 is to further develop applied biomedical knowledge, key clinical skills, and clinical reasoning in a broad range of clinical settings and medical disciplines. Students are expected to actively participate in a variety of different learning activities both online and in person, and to actively engage in clinical placement. The subject will be delivered in five 6-week terms. Over the course of the year students will be on clinical placement in General Practice, Mental health, Aged Care, Rehabilitation, Palliative Care, Child and Adolescent Health and Women\u2019s Health. Students will build on their understanding of health systems and teams and their understanding of transitions of care. Students will focus on becoming part of hospital-based and community-based teams to further develop their diagnostic, communication and management skills in the context of patients presenting with acute and chronic conditions in all age groups. Teaching activities include interactive modules that allow students to apply biomedical knowledge, clinical skills and clinical reasoning to develop a differential diagnosis and provide a management plan for core conditions and presentations; and understand risk assessment in health care and the role of preventative care, professional practice development and procedural skills training."
