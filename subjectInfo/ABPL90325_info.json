    "overview": [
        "The subject will expose you to the latest international developments in prefabrication and its application within construction. You will develop an appreciation for how prefabrication can be used to minimise or avoid many of the issues currently faced by the construction industry as well as the environmental, financial and social benefits that are possible.The construction and associated challenges and benefits of prefabrication will be demonstrated through a series of case studies and site visits.The use of prefabrication in construction will be covered at various scales and levels of complexity, including an in-depth look at a range of componentised, panelised and modular construction systems.You will also develop professional expertise in the analysis of prefabrication as an alternative approach to procurement within the construction industry."
