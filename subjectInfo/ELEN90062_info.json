        "The aim of the subject is to provide theoretical and practical treatment of high-speed electronics. Through the subject, students will grasp the fundamental properties and models of high-speed signals and interconnects, acquire high-speed digital design skills with a focus on the modelling, analysis, design and application of high speed transistors, logic gates and modern logic families, and master the high-speed analogue design capability including the design of oscillators and filters for RF applications. The students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art technologies that are shaping the fast evolving semiconductor industry.INDICATIVE CONTENT",
