        "This subject provides students with an introduction to critical argumentation in the visual arts by addressing significant issues and topics in the field of contemporary art. In particular, the course examines the relation between the critical concepts of vanguard modernism and postmodernist \u201ctrans-avantgarde\u201d and \u201cretro\u201d cultural phenomena. The course also investigates the relation between postmodernism and the mass media as well as the emergence of new media and new technologies.",
        "Throughout this semester students should learn to recognize and be able to critically interpret works of art characteristic of the period of the last half of the twentieth century in the dominance of post-modernism. They will discuss and critically debate key topics and text in class and present their study and conclusions through written assignments."
