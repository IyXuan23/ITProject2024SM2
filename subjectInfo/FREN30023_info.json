    "overview": [
        "Understanding French in a global context is an essential competency for students of French in today\u2019s intercultural and transnational societies. Global French Studies is therefore our capstone subject for French major and Diploma in Languages students who have not taken French 7. It offers students the opportunity to activate their knowledge of advanced French through applying their research and analytical skills to topics of contemporary relevance for both academic and professional pathways. Drawing on the current research of French Program staff, seminars will provide students with a space to learn from staff research expertise and to develop their own collaborative and individual research projects. Areas of staff research specialisation include French and Francophone literature, cinema, theatre, translation, applied linguistics, travel writing, food and wine, medieval French, postcolonialism and decolonisation. The subject will be taught and assessed in French."
