    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed to build on students\u2019 knowledge and critical appraisal skills gained in the pre-requisite subject, Evidence in Practice (NURS90120) to utilise and implement the best available evidence into clinicians\u2019 practice. The subject aims to apply the skills from Evidence in Practice and translate evidence-based research into clinical decision-making and practice. This subject is designed to engage you in and equip you to utilise evidence in your practice to enhance or optimise the way clinical practice is conducted to deliver better care and develop the discipline of nursing. The subject will consider frameworks and organisational processes to support evidence translation, identified enablers and barriers to practice reform, and formulate strategies to assist with the implementation of evidence into practice."
