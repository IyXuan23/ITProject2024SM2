        "The subject examines the business environment and the role of the manager, including an overview of the nature and history of management, the forces affecting contemporary organisations, and the management skills needed to succeed in today's business world. Students should gain an understanding of the definition of management, be able to describe the kinds of managers found in organisations, and identify and briefly explain the four basic management functions. The subject will focus on the roles and skills of management with special attention to managerial responsibility for effective and efficient achievement of goals. Special attention will be given to the importance of managerial ethics and social responsibility in management and how managers can influence their organisations\u2019 ethics and social responsiveness. The concepts and theories related to goal setting and planning, strategy formulation and implementation, management decision-making, and increasing productivity through control systems will be reviewed. Issues relating to designing an effective organisation structure, managing organisational change, and maintaining an effective workforce will also be explored. Considerable reliance is placed on case analysis to refine the capacity of students to apply relevant theory and principles."
