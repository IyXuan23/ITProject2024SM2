    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces and develops Teacher Candidates\u2019 practical and theoretical understandings of learning in and through the Arts and creative pedagogies in the primary classroom. Teacher Candidates engage with the Drama, Music and Visual Arts components of the Australian/Victorian Curricula, investigating their application as individual artforms and across the Arts Learning Area, the Capabilities, and the Cross-Curricular Priorities.",
        "Teacher Candidates are introduced to practical approaches to foreground Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives in and through the Arts in primary schools. A range of resources (strategies, ideas, tools, techniques, digital technologies) are explored for supporting student participation and engagement in arts-based classroom experiences that cater for diverse learners. Teacher Candidates link their studio practice to relevant theory and school experience to formulate a rationale for their emerging arts pedagogy, with an emphasis on continued professional learning in the arts."
