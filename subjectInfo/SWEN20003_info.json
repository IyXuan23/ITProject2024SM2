        "Developing medium and large scale software systems requires analysis and design prior to implementation. This subject introduces students to software design, with specific focus on object-oriented design, and the implementation of designs using an object-oriented programming language. The subject aims to lay the foundations to software design, and is the first subject of a sequence of subjects that teaches the students the concepts in software design."
