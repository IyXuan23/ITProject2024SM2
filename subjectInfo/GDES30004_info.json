        "This subject builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in the pre-requisite subject, aiming at further developing the student\u2019s critical and technical skills in the representation of design through drawing and model making.",
        "Students are introduced via lectures to a range of visualization precedents and in workshops to analogue model making, painting and drawing techniques.",
        "Scale models, perspective drawings and renderings are generated which can then be imported into the digital realm to be further developed. The outcome will be the beginning of a portfolio of images demonstrating the student\u2019s capacity to express design ideas fluently and articulately."
