        "This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.",
        "This subject is focused on how to optimise one\u2019s own personal performance. It critically examines psychological, sociological and scientific research related to expertise development and examines a range of embodied, and frequently tacit, everyday practices that enable progress in all aspects of human endeavour.",
        "By highlighting both similarities and differences between various performance domains it aims to capture, understand, inspire and disrupt ways of thinking about one\u2019s personal performance that cut across a wide array of domains, including the arts, business, medicine and science.",
        "Attention is given to the various sub-skills of performance, especially the conditions that enhance expectations for future performance, influence personal autonomy, and facilitate attention focusing within various contexts.",
        "Students will be encouraged to implement skills and strategies within their own domain-specific learning that can help them optimise their own personal performance and development."
