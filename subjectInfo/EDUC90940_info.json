    "overview": [
        "This subject examines education policy reform in different national contexts, including Australia. Students will critically examine the main international trends in education reform and how they are manifested in a national context. These trends include: education as a tool of economic policy, approaches to regulation and quality, standardised testing, employability/21st century skills, and responding to changes in the labour market. Students will analyse the conceptual ideas underpinning education policy reform as well as the cultural, socio-economic and political forces shaping policy development and the politics of reform. Students will draw on a range of theories and approaches to examine policy responses to issues such as disengagement, youth unemployment and the relatively low status of vocational education."
