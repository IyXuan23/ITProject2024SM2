        "The ambition to shape our habitat and to understand the universe in which we reside has occurred in all cultures and across all epochs. The human need to know more and to do more has led to the rapid expansion of knowledge and technology that we see around us and is largely driven by advances in science.",
        "In this subject, we adopt an interdisciplinary approach to investigate how today\u2019s science might be harnessed to make tomorrow\u2019s world a better place, by addressing the most significant challenges that seem likely to emerge in our future: climate change and environmental sustainability.",
        "The natural sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology) inform our decisions about energy, materials, living systems, the earth and the universe. The formal sciences (Mathematics and Information Technologies) enable us to develop quantitative models of our environment. The applied sciences (Engineering, Agriculture) develop more efficient uses of energy and new ways to accommodate a growing population. The social sciences (psychology, sociology) provide tools to understand how people interact with one another and their environment.",
        "Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Science (Extended) students will acquire an understanding of the scope of the current scientific research at the University of Melbourne and discover the power and potential of science to make a positive impact on the future of the planet.",
        "Pass/Fail Grade",
