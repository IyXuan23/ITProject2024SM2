        "Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The central issues of this course deal with understanding the behavior of individuals, groups, and organizations in the context of competitive situations. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. The course is designed to be relevant to the broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by the manager and professional, often in a global context.",
        "This course is designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills learned in other courses at MBS. A basic premise of the course is that while a manager needs analytical skills to discover optimal solutions to problems, a broad array of negotiation skills is needed in order for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course will give you the opportunity to develop these skills experientially and to understand negotiation in useful analytical frameworks."
