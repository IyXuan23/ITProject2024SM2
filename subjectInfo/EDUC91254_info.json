    "overview": [
        "This subject builds upon the theory and practice of teaching established in Learning Area Media Studies 1 by further developing Interns\u2019 repertoire of subject specific practices and teaching resources and deepen their understanding of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment of VCE Media Studies, and the Clinical Teaching Model.",
        "Interns will build on their knowledge of planning, structuring and sequencing learning programs, and are supported to identify and use teaching and classroom communication strategies designed to improve learning outcomes. Interns will be supported to reflect on, evaluate and improve their teaching programs. This includes developing an understanding of differentiation as a tool to cater for diverse learners and to promote student engagement and participation. Interns will also build their capacity to assess and provide feedback on student learning using a variety of tools.",
        "The assessment tasks in this subject will support the development of Interns\u2019 understanding of the roles of assessment in teaching and learning, along with the integration of curriculum, assessment and reporting knowledge into the development of teaching and learning sequences."
