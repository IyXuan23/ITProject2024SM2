    "overview": [
        "Plant-based foods are the most important source of energy and micronutrients in the human diet. Over 200 species of plant are farmed and are processed to varying degrees for human consumption and Australian agriculture has a tradition of thousands more.",
        "The challenge is to meet the food demands of an increasing human population and to maintain the nutritional composition of raw food materials. Thus, the need for food professionals who understand the science behind the sustainable processing and supply of food along with the right balance of nutrition and food safety has never been greater.",
        "This subject will provide students with an advanced understanding of the processing and preservation of grain, fruit and vegetable produce into food products through an integrated approach of science and technology. Students will study and connect with the origin of plant-based food produce, the original chemical and nutritional composition, food technology, changes in the nutritional profile during processing and preservation.",
        "Students will understand the  connection between food quality and processing; the science behind processing and the quality maintenance of the processed products. Students will develop skills in critical-thinking, analysing and applying interactions of chemical compositions of plant produce and applied technology to achieve desired processed food products; industry visits; discussion; written review and examination.",
        "The subject will include topics such as:",
        "The variety of plant-based produce",
        "the chemical and nutritional composition of plant-based produce",
        "Pre-processing handling of plant produce",
        "Cereal and legumes processing technology",

        "Interpret the demand of certain types of processed food products based on the production of food products and ingredients of plant origin with technological advancement to the future",
        "Perform experiments to demonstrate how composition and processing techniques affect the structure and quality of food"
