        "Urban Transport systems face many challenges due to growing levels of congestion and rising levels of environmental, social and safety problems.",
        "This subject will use the systems approach as a framework for developing the key skills that need to be acquired to develop and implement new transport technologies that can improve the sustainability of urban transport systems.",
        "This course will focus on (1) the fundamental knowledge to understand transport systems from the perspective of an engineer and planner, and on (2) how new technologies can be integrated with existing transport services to improve accessibility and sustainability in transport systems. Key skills will be attained in the areas of data collection and processing, analysis, and evaluation."
