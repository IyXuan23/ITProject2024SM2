        "This subject brings together the two major threads from the first semester\u2019s subjects and presents participants with opportunities to apply the principles in their own clinical workplaces. More difficult teaching situations and the strategies to resolve them will be explored. The emphasis is practical, with participants using the theories and concepts explored in the previous semester during their usual clinical teaching and supervision activities, then reflecting on the effectiveness of their work after receiving feedback from peers and students. A collaborative workshop at the beginning of the semester and another at the completion support this practical experience. An intensive option will appeal to clinicians requiring greater flexibility.Teaching days are generally held at the Parkville campus and are shared with the corequisite subject (\u2018Assessing Clinical Learners\u2019). Apart from the workshops to prepare for and debrief from the peer review exercise (2 hours each), participants will engage in small group sessions with tutors (8 hours) and lecture-style presentations (4 hours).",
