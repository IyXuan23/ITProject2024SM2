    "overview": [
        "The structure, organisation and culture of schools are critically explored through the conceptual tool of framing. Several frames are used to understand the typical forms schools take, and how people are organized in these forms. Re-framing, organizational behaviour, and successful school leadership conceptions provide the necessary conceptual lenses to critique school structure, organisation, and culture, whilst, several views of change management are used to explore why these forms are enduring, The subject also explore how schools can be transformed to respond to the contemporary learning needs of students. The ideas explored provide the foundation for developing school success within an instructional leadership orientation. This subject aligns with the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership National Professional Standard for Principals."
