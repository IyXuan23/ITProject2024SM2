    "aims": [
        "This subject is intended to help students understand (a) what in packaged enterprise application software (PEAS) is, (b) how such software is implemented, and (c) how organisations can maximize benefits from their often-large investments in packaged-software-based systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Business-Intelligence (BI) systems. These systems are important because most organisations around the world today rely on such systems to support their core business processes."

    "indicative content": [
        "The subject discusses (a) what enterprise-systems software is, (b) claimed advantages and limitations of enterprise systems, (c) how best to implement packaged enterprise application software, (d) future directions that PEAS are likely to head as vendors respond to market pressures for integration between heterogeneous information systems, cloud computing, greater access from mobile devices, and demand for more information faster than ever before, and (e) what organisations need to do to maximize benefits from their often-large investments in packaged enterprise application software. Students will normally undertake approximately 10-15 hours of hands-on exercises with software from a leading vendor, SAP.",
