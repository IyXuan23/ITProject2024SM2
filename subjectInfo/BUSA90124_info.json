    "overview": [
        "The course begins with a review of strategy to ensure that there is a shared understanding of the basic concepts and frameworks of strategy. After this foundation is established, the course is organized around two general questions: 1) Is the organization structured in a manner that will allow the implementation of strategy? and 2) Do the people in the organization want to implement the strategy? Structural issues are mainly driven by the way the various parts of the organization relate to each other and interact. The structure often yields results that are detrimental to the organization and impede the execution of the strategy. Similarly, the culture of an organization frequently fails to engage employees and inspire any commitment to realizing the organization\u2019s strategy. The course will develop the ability to recognize barriers to successful implementation and provide concepts, tools, and frameworks that are necessary to frame and execute a sustainable competitive advantage."
