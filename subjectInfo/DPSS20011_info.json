        "In this subject, students focus on the specialist areas of their choice, selecting two of the modules they successfully completed (achieving a pass grade or higher) in Production Studio 2. This subject develops a further understanding of the production process in order for students to collaborate effectively with performance makers and production departments in the creation of live performance, while also developing skills to sustain themselves as independent practitioners.Through studio-based classes students will develop a comprehensive understanding of the chosen specialist areas and progress their skill level for employing these in the context of live performance."
