Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the foundations of social science research and become familiar with different methods of inquiry in the social sciences, with an emphasis on qualitative approaches, including their respective strengths and limitations. Students will also become able to reflect on their own position in the world as this relates to knowledge production and ways of knowing. Through examples and activities students learn to critically assess the quality of social research."
