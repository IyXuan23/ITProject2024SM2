        "This subject provides an introduction to the key environmental challenges in contemporary China and to China\u2019s environmental governance. The subject is structured around four topics: water resources, land resources, air pollution, and energy and climate change. For each of these topics lectures and tutorials will analyse impacts, policy and governance arrangements, citizen and NGO involvement, government and media discourse, and international linkages. Students will be introduced to key theoretical debates in China studies, development studies and human geography to help them understand the complexities of China\u2019s environmental challenges. Using the environment as a lens, students will gain an understanding of politics and state-society relations in contemporary China."
