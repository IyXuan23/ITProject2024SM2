    "overview": [
        "Digital Protocols examines the maintenance of culture using digital materials and methods. Emerging practices are presented using a mix of lectures, seminars, workshops and group work. Students engage with the social and technical issues underpinning digital heritage, and the evolving artistic and institutional practices reshaping conservation through the digital preservation of media libraries, and the time-based media conservation of contemporary artworks. A critical engagement with persistent preservation practices is prioritised to develop practical conservation plans for distinct physical, economic cultural settings.",
        "During the pre-teaching period students are expected to complete the course readings, review the lectures and any other course preparation as outlined on the LMS. The LMS will become available at the commencement of the pre-teaching dates."
