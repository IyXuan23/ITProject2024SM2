    "overview": [
        "This subject was formerly known as Construction Design.",
        "This subject articulates and tests the idea of construction as a process requiring cultural and technical choices. While Construction Analysis focuses on the internal mechanics of building systems, Architectural Tectonics moves from the analysis of specific architectural ideas to arrive at the evaluation and selection of implementation alternatives. Mixing built examples and project proposals, students will be shown how to identify, evaluate and engage with the technological underpinnings of architecture."
