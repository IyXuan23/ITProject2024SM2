    "overview": [
        "The delivery of legal services is undergoing rapid and deep change. Technology, client expectations, service delivery models outside the conventional law firm approach and generational change have all transformed the legal profession. There is increasing recognition of the ways in which Australia\u2019s legal systems have been built on a foundation that systematically erases Indigenous Law and perspectives. Future lawyers need to be able to understand and respond to these challenges and to develop new understanding, skills and approaches to their work.",
        "This subject will examine current and future changes in the delivery of legal services and legal work and identify and develop key skills and approaches that graduates will require to succeed professionally and personally in their future working lives and to achieve justice for clients and communities. Students will critically examine the structural barriers to access to justice and legal empowerment that are created by both traditional legal service provision models and lawyers\u2019 skillsets.",
        "Students will engage with current literature on the future of legal work, the changing role of the lawyer, navigating complexity, building creativity, empathy and emotional intelligence, indigenous cultural competency and safety, intercultural understanding, unconscious bias and personal and professional wellbeing and resilience.  Underpinning this approach is the recognition that students need to understand and articulate their own standpoint and develop their awareness and capacity to engage respectfully, effectively and safely with others.",
        "This subject will have a substantial experiential learning focus. Students will develop a deeper appreciation of the need for and process of professional identity formation, the role of reflective practice, giving and receiving feedback and peer support in enhancing personal wellbeing and as part of a sustainable practice in the law."
