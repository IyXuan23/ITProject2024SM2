    "overview": [
        "This subject provides students with the necessary language and intercultural skills to communicate in everyday situations in Spanish through project-based and object-based assessment tasks and in-class activities. Students work together to curate an online exhibition, engaging with authentic cultural materials, such as visual artworks, to develop their reading, listening and speaking skills, as well as their digital literacy. Students are afforded a taste of the richness of the Hispanic World while developing workplace skills such as problem-solving, team work, clear communication, curation, information literacy and professionalism. Students are introduced to the grammatical structures and vocabulary that allow them to converse in a number of informal situations, and which will connect them to the societies and cultures of the global Spanish-speaking community. Students develop writing strategies that enable them to produce a number of descriptive, personal texts, such as emails, letters and family profiles. They are encouraged to develop personal awareness and an understanding of diverse cultural identities that make up the Hispanic world.",
        "Part of the assessment of this subject will contribute to the ePortfolio students develop in their Spanish and Latin American Studies subjects. This digital platform offers students the opportunity to showcase relevant workplace skills and digital and intercultural competencies in the target language, as well as individual interests and ideas."
