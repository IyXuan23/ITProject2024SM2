        "Students will undertake as individuals or as a member of a team a designated investigative project which could involve a critical literature review, experimental research and/or development, theoretical modelling, process simulation and/or the solution of an industrial problem. Rigorous planning and scheduling of the project, time management, written and verbal technical communication, interpretation of results and team work will be required. Lectures will be presented on laboratory safety, and the use of statistical methods for experimental data analysis.",
