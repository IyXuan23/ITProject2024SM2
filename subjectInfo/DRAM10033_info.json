        "This subject introduces the physical, vocal and creative skills that inform and enable the development of theatrical performance. The foundations are laid for the development of character, engagement with text for performance, and the composition of original creative work.",
        "Voice and movement classes address idiosyncratic habits which may inhibit the performer to develop functional, efficient and flexible physical and vocal expression for performance and character development.",
        "Students will apply this growing understanding as they work spontaneously and imaginatively within a theatrical context; via improvisation and text-based work. In applying technical skills to training tasks and exercises, students will develop their performative and collaborative abilities.",
