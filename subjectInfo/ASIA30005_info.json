        "This subject will move beyond simple comparisons between nation-states by looking at Japan and the Korean Peninsula as a regional space of historical overlap and cultural intersection. By critically examining cultural expressions such as literature, film, and television drama, this subject will analyse historical narratives and claims of legitimacy, the processes involved in the construction of \u201cnational\u201d culture, as well as each country\u2019s engagement with the broader international community. Lectures will focus on concepts as well as historical and cultural context, which will then be applied to the analysis of cultural texts during tutorial sessions."
