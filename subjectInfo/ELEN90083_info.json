        "This subject is for students to undertake a substantial individual research project on an approved topic over the semester, requiring independent investigation with a chosen supervisor either from a university (research institute) or from an industry partner.",
        "Note: the student is responsible for contacting the potential supervisor for the project.",
        "This subject can also be taken by Master of Electrical Engineering outgoing exchange students for research projects carried out in an overseas university.",
        "If the project is to be carried out within the EEE Department, the student is encouraged to take ELEN90011 (Directed Studies) if possible.",
        "The emphasis of the project can be associated with either",
        "A well-defined project description, often based on a task required by an external, industrial client. Students will be tutored in the synthesis of practical solutions to complex technical problems within a structured working environment, as if they were professional engineering practitioners; or",
        "A project description that will require an explorative approach, where students will pursue outcomes associated with new knowledge or understanding, often as an adjunct to existing academic research initiatives.",
        "It is expected that the project will incorporate findings associated with both well-defined professional practice and research principles."
