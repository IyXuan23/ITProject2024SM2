    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to provide opportunities for students to gain an understanding in, and extend the practice of biomedical research.The student will conduct an original research project in a basic or clinical research laboratory under the supervision of a research scientist from the Dept during the period February to November.The student will be introduced to current literature and techniques in specialised areas.The research project will form part of a larger project or the basis of an expanded project. In both cases the work may culminate in an original research publication."
