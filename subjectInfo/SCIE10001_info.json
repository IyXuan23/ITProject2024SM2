        "Science provides a view of the living world and its environment that uses observation and measurement to build an understanding of the function of parts of a system and the interactions between them. This subject aims to develop students\u2019 understanding of this evidence-based approach, integrating the contributions of biology, chemistry, earth sciences and physics.",
