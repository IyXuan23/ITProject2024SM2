    "overview": [
        "This subject explores learning across the school years from a developmental perspective with a focus on understanding the processes involved in how learners learn. It also investigates how difficulties with learning arise related to cognitive processes like attention, information processing, executive functioning, and self-regulation. The relevance of the science of learning to classroom interactions will also be investigated, with a focus on the use of evidence-based principles of instruction and multi-tiered logic and collaborative practice in support of effective differentiated practice for diverse learners."
