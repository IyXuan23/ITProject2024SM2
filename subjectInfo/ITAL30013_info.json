    "overview": [
        "Students continue intensive revision and further development of the major areas of contemporary Italian language and culture. Through the analysis of language structures with a practical focus, students will extend their linguistic capacities in reading, writing, listening, speaking and describing the Italian language. Students also explore aspects of contemporary Italian literature, society and history through a programmatic study of post-war Italy. Students develop a critical capacity enabling them to understand and analyse a variety of text types (film, music, mass media, literature, etc.). Communication skills will also be developed through online and face-to-face collaboration in a range of in- and out-of-class activities, including a work-integrated learning group project which involves practical application of Italian language in a school setting."
