        "This subject provides an introduction to process work in process engineering, focusing specifically on process safety and sustainability. Material taught in other chemical engineering subjects will be reinforced via a series of assignments in which ill-defined and open-ended process engineering problems will be tackled. Both hypothetical and real case studies from the process engineering field are used throughout the subject.",
        "Several assessment tasks combine to form a capstone project. Within this project students, in teams of three or four, perform design tasks related to the development of a Chemical Process Engineering facility. This capstone project culminates in an Environmental Effects Statement assignment. Several industry speakers, from the process engineering and environmental areas, talk and provide content to aid with this assignment.",
