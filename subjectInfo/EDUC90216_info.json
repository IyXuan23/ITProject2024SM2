These include independent assessment and psychological reporting writing; developing and implementing evidence-based interventions; problem identification and case formulation; attending professional meetings; communicating with other agencies and interdisciplinary teamwork; providing consultation to a range of personnel and stakeholders; engaging in project design, implementation, and development; delivering professional development as appropriate. Students are required to conduct themselves in an autonomous professional manner; develop projects around issues of concern; communicate and consult with a range of professions and agencies and have an appreciation of the value of team work when appropriate; and utilise the combination of education and psychology to enhance practice.",
        "The placement provides the opportunity to autonomously carry out the tasks of an educational and developmental psychologist under supervision and in accordance with Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) professional competency standards. Opportunities to receive feedback are built into the task design. This placement facilitates the development of an appreciation of complex professional issues, ethics, and identity. There are a series of lectures covering issues of professional practice, ethics, case formulation skills, report writing, supervision, and contemporary issues in educational and developmental psychology practice."
