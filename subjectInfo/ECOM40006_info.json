        "This subject introduces appropriate estimation and inference techniques for models that involve a single equation and those involving systems of equations. Normally topics will include asymtotic theory, maximum likelihood estimation, classical testing procedures, generalised least squares estimation, seemingly unrelated regression models, stochastic regressors, instrumental variables, generalised methods of moments, simultaneous equations models (including VARs) and model-selection procedures."
