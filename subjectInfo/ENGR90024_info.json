        "AIM",
        "Within this subject you will learn how to use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to solve practical industrial and research related fluid flow and heat/mass transfer problems.  The major assessment within this subject is a capstone project, requiring a CFD treatment of a major piece of equipment related to your degree discipline area.  This project may be industry or research based. Learning is supported by a number of structured group-based workshops completed throughout the semester, requiring completion of associated on-line quizzes.  Guest lectures from academia and industry will share insights into how they use CFD in their research/workplace.",
        "SUBJECT CONTENT",
        "The content of this subject is split between two related modules:",
        "1) Fundamentals of CFD: Within this module we will cover the mathematical basis of modern CFD methods, using MATLAB as a programming tool to demonstrate specific fundamental concepts.  Specific topics include overview, conservation laws, advection-diffusion equations, differencing schemes, finite volume method, stability analysis, error analysis, boundary conditions and solution algorithms for solving Navier-Stokes equations.",
        "2) Applications of CFD: This module will be based around the industry-relevant CFD package ANSYS Fluent. Specific topics include: How to run a basic simulation, meshing, laminar 2D and 3D flows, boundary conditions, discretisation methods, visualisation, turbulence, disperse multiphase flows, free-surface multiphase flows, coupled heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions, use of CFD in industry and research.",
