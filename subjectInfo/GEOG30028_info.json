    "overview": [
        "The scale of contemporary travel is staggering. Tourists, businesspeople, refugees, passengers, commuters, students, backpackers, migrants, stowaways, pirates, terrorists\u2014and many more\u2014are on the move.Travel has often been seen as devoid of economic, political and socio-cultural significance. But issues of movement\u2014too much or too little; too fast or too slow; or the wrong sort at the wrong time\u2014are central to many present-day controversies. From airport expansion to design responses to climate change; and from the spectre of driverless cars to the plight of homeless people, issues of \u2018mobility\u2019 are centre stage.",
        "",
        "To better understand power in our contemporary world, we need to understand the meanings attached to these movements; how these movements feel; how fast things move; the routes these movements take; and how and when things stop. Through this subject we will explore how mobility is a fundamental part of our world.This subject is taught intensively over two weeks through lectures, seminars, workshops, and fieldtrips involving fieldwork in different areas of central Melbourne."
