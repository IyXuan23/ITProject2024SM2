    "overview": [
        "This subject enables students to conduct a research topic under supervision, as approved by an academic project supervisor. The research is conducted as a group project with 2-3 students. The work commitment over one semester will be equivalent to lecture and practical based subjects worth 25 points. The content and extent of the project will be determined by the subject coordinator and project supervisor in consultation with the students. Students will be offered different group projects to choose. Alternatively, students can also initiate project ideas or to identify a project topic of keen interest to the group, through discussion with Faculty staff, prior to subject commencement.",
        "The project represents a capstone subject and comprises a review of a body of relevant literature, together with a critical evaluation of research or experimental protocols, a modest experiment, or limited exploration of a scientific problem, or an investigation into a problem using an approved methodology. Following an initial workshop to establish subject expectations, deliverables and skill base requirements, projects will generally involve regular meetings with subject coordinator and supervisor where students report on progress, difficulties and research plans. Other workshops will deliver skill development in oral and written report presentation.",
        "Note:For students enrolled in the Semester 1 offering, a Dookie campus visit of up to two weeks will be required unless an exemption is granted."
