        "This subject explores theory and the process of design for the creative sector. A range of approaches to design will be examined through the consideration of current and historical precedents in performance, screen, exhibition and publication. These ideas will be applied to a series of studio\u2010based projects designed to develop the student\u2019s conceptual skills.Students will also develop the relevant fundamental skills and techniques for documenting and communicating design for their chosen specialisation including model making, concept drawing, perspective drawing, technical drawing, image processing, layout, illustration, and CAD drafting."
