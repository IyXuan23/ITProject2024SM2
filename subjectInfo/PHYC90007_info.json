    "overview": [
        "Quantum Mechanics introduces a dramatically new and rich understanding of the universe. In addition to providing a much deeper insight into the world of atoms and subatomic particles than afforded by classical Newtonian physics, Quantum Mechanics underpins advances in science across all disciplines, from molecular biology to astrophysics. This subject provides a rigorous mathematical formalism for advanced quantum mechanics, laying the foundation for further fundamental theoretical physics and research-level experimental physics in frontier areas such as quantum communication and quantum computation.",
        "The subject describes the Hilbert-space formulation of quantum wave mechanics, including density matrix descriptions for single and joint Hilbert space systems; symmetries and conservation laws including rotations and angular momentum; the path integral approach; perturbation theory applications, and scattering theory."

        "demonstrate the use of density matrices for single and joint Hilbert spaces;",
        "demonstrate the difference between pure and mixed states, and entanglement and their relevance in quantum mechanics;",
        "understand the basic formalism of path integrals;",
        "apply perturbation methods to physical systems and thus predict measurable outcomes; and",
        "apply the concepts of scattering theory."
