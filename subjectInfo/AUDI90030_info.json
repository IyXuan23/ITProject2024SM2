Traditional and current approaches to the investigation of language disorders across the lifespan will be included, as well as the importance of multicultural factors. The focus will be on the description, assessment, differential diagnosis and treatment of developmental and acquired language disorders. The course will also discuss the characteristics of different language disorders within the context of academic achievement (literacy) and family, peer and work relationships."
