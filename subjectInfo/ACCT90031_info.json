        "Diverse stakeholders are increasingly demanding information about the broader social and environmental dimensions of organizational performance. Incorporating this information into decision-making is complex because it tends to be non-financial in nature and traditional models tend to focus on financial information. This course will investigate issues associated with production, reporting, and use of sustainability related information for decision-making. At a broader level, the course will help students to develop their critical thinking and analytical skills to help them apply their knowledge to settings where extant models do not fit well."
