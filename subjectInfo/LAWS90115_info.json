    "overview": [
        "Outer space, high seas, the deep seabed and Antarctica are areas governed by international law using the same set of legal principles centred around international management, non-appropriation, equitable use and peaceful purposes. The importance of these international areas and their resources has increased exponentially over the past 30 years due to globalisation and the need for these resources. New technologies, increasing demands for new resources, climate change and exotic tourism, driven by a tripling of the global economy over the next 30 years, mean that their importance will again increase dramatically. Management of these areas and their valuable resources is a rapidly developing area of international law that will affect many different areas of commerce and the law. This subject provides a unique opportunity to learn from two international lawyers with practical experience in the field.",
