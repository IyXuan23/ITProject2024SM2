        "This subject aims to provide students with an introduction to the fundamental principles and practical applications of the major analytical techniques used in cultural materials conservation. The subject builds upon the students' knowledge gained in CUMC90032 Technical Examination and Documentation, and CUMC90033 Cultural Materials Conservation Science. It covers methods accessible in a conservation laboratory and instrumental methods based upon:",

        "Molecular spectroscopy (FTIR and Raman)",
        "Chromatography (GC-MS and HPLC).",
        "Students learn to devise appropriate testing regimes, acquire control samples, prepare samples (eg. cross section), undertake analysis and manage analytical data.  Students will gain an understanding of the practical application of a range of analytical techniques (including their advantages and disadvantages, their sampling requirements, and whether the sample is destroyed) and the interpretation of results.  Students will apply fundamental examination and analytical techniques to the study of:",
