    "overview": [
        "This subject will enable students to integrate and extend prior knowledge on lifestyle and wellness behaviours to effectively and safely support optimal health of individuals, groups and specific populations across the lifespan and along the health and impairment continuum. Students will draw critically on the evidence for lifestyle behaviours needed for good health with an emphasis on the recommendations for physical activity and exercise.  Students will also explore health risks due to sedentary behaviour and other lifestyle choices (such as poor diet, sleep hygiene and stress), and investigate current options for delivery and evaluation of programs to manage these risks and incorporate evidence informed behavioural interventions to promote optimal health. Students will build on their clinical reasoning skills to theorise the mechanism of an individuals' health deficits from an holistic, patient-centred, biopsychosocial perspective, and design a plan that includes a physical activity program plus other lifestyle changes to meet the goals of optimal health outcomes for an individual. Students will be expected to be critical in their analysis and evaluations of new and emerging evidence base around lifestyle choices.",
        "All students will complete a Foundational module (Weeks 1-3) that will explore the pathophysiological and psychosocial theory of rehabilitation and evidence\u2013based health outcomes of lifestyle and wellness behaviours with an emphasis on physical activity but also including other healthy lifestyle choices. A biopsychosocial framework will emphasise the biological, mechanical, social, psychological and cultural elements that influence health and health-enhancing behaviour.",
        "Students will then choose three from five modules that best meets their learning interests and/or practice needs. These modules are:",
        "The final integration module will be completed by all students. Students will consider their role, in terms of their health profession and practice context, in facilitating healthier lifestyles and improved wellbeing of their patients/clients. The final module (Week 8) will also focus on the design and evaluation of an holistic lifestyle intervention to meet the needs of an individual or a group with common impairments or health needs. Students will apply a model of rehabilitation best practice and using an ICF informed framework, in the execution of this task.",
        "In this subject, students will also reflect on their personal attitudes to lifestyle choices and the privilege of their background and opportunities. They will concisely and effectively communicate their understanding of the range of options their patients/clients, in their particular practice context(s), have to improve their health and wellbeing."
