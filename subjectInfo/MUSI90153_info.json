        "Professional Practice 2 is a work experience subject for students to continue observations and gain further experience of music performance teaching. Where possible, students will be placed in a contrasting setting to Professional Practice 1.",
        "These settings may include private music studios and group teaching situations in commercial music schools (for example Yamaha Music School) and community music education settings (for example Melbourne Youth Music Council ensembles, Dandenong Ranges Music Council ensembles, Malvern City Band, Australian Boys Choir), as well as primary and secondary schools.",
        "These placements will be under the supervision both of in situ teachers/musical directors/tutors and Melbourne Conservatorium of Music academic staff.",
        "Placement",
        "Students are required to complete 10 days (60-hours) of placement, during which they will continue observations of teaching practice and participate extensively in supervised teaching of individual students or groups as required.",
        "Students will create lesson plans that include implementation strategies, and after teaching each lesson, they will receive feedback from their supervisors. Melbourne Conservatorium of Music staff will be present to grade some of this teaching. Students will also be assessed on a personal-professional portfolio that will include observations, lesson planning, implementation, assessment and post-implementation documentation of their teaching experiences.",
        "Prior to, and immediately after the placement, students will attend compulsory seminars to provide an introduction to and reflections on these music performance teaching settings and relevant learning objectives."
