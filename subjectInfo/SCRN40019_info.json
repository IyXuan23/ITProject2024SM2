    "overview": [
        "Screen & Cultural Research Seminar is a seminar and workshop series for students writing an Honours thesis in Screen and Cultural Studies. The subject introduces students to discipline-specific contemporary research practices and methodologies appropriate to their interests and research. It provides a practical platform for their academic training via a series of research seminars convened by the Screen and Cultural Studies program. Topics covered in any given year may include but are not limited to entertainment, news, workplace and art screen-based media; historical, feminist, queer, anti-racist, class-based and decolonial screen media, cultures and analytic practices; settler, indigenous and gendered cultures; and cultural forms and practices associated with media, community formation, screen industries, transmedia, performance and intercultural relations.",
        "In the Screen & Cultural Research Seminar, students will learn how to formulate research questions, identify research fields of enquiry, develop a literature review, and deliver and participate in research presentations. They will acquire understanding of ethical dimensions of research, including training in human subject research procedures and University ethics requirements where required. The subject supports students in developing their Honours thesis projects and encourages them to develop their own academic research culture."
