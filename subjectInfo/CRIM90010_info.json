        "Crime prevention is a growth area in applied criminology, and many graduates find themselves working in this field. This subject provides a basic understanding of relevant theory and practice. Current national and international developments are summarised and analyzed, and approaches to crime prevention are critically assessed. Specific topics include social prevention, environmental prevention, crime prevention through environmental design and the police and the business sector's roles in crime prevention. Evaluation of prevention programs and strategies also is discussed. In line with the subject's policy emphasis, part of the assessment involves summarising and assessing a major Australian crime prevention initiative."
