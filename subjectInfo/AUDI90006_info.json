    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on the basic paediatric assessment skills gained in Paediatric Audiology A. Students will have the opportunity to learn the principles and practice of audiological assessment of children of all ages. Students will refine and expand their understanding of advanced paediatric testing techniques; educational and communication issues for hearing impaired children; assessment and management of children with special needs; assessment and management of hearing-impaired neonates and infants. Supervised clinical experience will be obtained in the diagnosis and management of hearing disorders in children of all ages.",
        "Students are expected to meet the core participation requirements of the Masters of Clinical Audiology. Lectures, practicals, small group discussions/PBLs are all highly interactive and students are expected to participate and contribute in all classes. Teaching will be conducted face to face in large-group lectures, small group discussions/PBLs, and practical sessions (approximately 3 hours/week including the asynchronous activities such as pre-class readings/modules and optional quizzes that are there to help students gauge their level of understanding and identify current gaps in knowledge).",
        "The subject is part of the clinical placement program. Students should be expected to be allocated to clinical placements at the University Clinic and across metropolitan and rural services including hospitals and community settings."
