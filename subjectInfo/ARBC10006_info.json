        "This subject forms a thorough introduction to spoken and written Arabic language and Arab culture for students with some knowledge of Arabic. Students will gain an understanding of, and the ability to use constructively some important structures of the language. Vocabulary and grammar will be learnt and activated through working with texts affording insights into Arab culture, at this stage concentrating on sociocultural matters related to interpersonal, intergenerational and family relations, some aspects of everyday living and social conventions.",
        "Students will also begin developing a good knowledge of the Arab World, its countries, aspects of traditions and some of the personages who have helped shape the ideas that have informed its recent past. They will acquire the ability to express themselves at a basic level about these topics both in speaking and in writing. In the process, students will be aided by state-of-the-art textbooks, authentic language materials, both written and audio-visual, and the interactive online program developed by Asia Institute staff."
