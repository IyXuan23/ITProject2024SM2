    ],
    "overview": [
        "This subject will cover the application of chemical engineering principles to modern food processing and packaging. Students will develop a broad understanding of the nature of food components and the principles underlying their processing. The importance of sustainability principles in food manufacture will be a key focus, as the industry adapts to the challenges of climate change and limited water resources. The subject will allow students to learn how to apply chemical and bioprocess engineering knowledge in the design and implementation of important industrial food processes with minimal environmental footprint. The principles and technical knowledge developed in this subject are central to chemical engineers working in the food industry.",
        "",
        "Topics will include an overview of processes for preserving and transforming food, fundamentals of food chemistry, water activity and drying, microbial control, evaluation and statistical data analysis of sensory properties and product formulation. Mechanisms to reduce the sodium, water and energy footprint of food processing and to minimise food waste will be presented. Content will be provided on the requirements for food packaging and particularly on the use of biodegradable packaging from a sustainability perspective.  Particular focus will be given to important processed foods such as dairy (cheese, dairy powders, and yoghurt manufacture) and fermented beverages (wine and beer production)."
