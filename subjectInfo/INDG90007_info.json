        "This subject provides the opportunity for Fellows of the Atlantic Fellows for Social Equity (AFSE program) to develop a social change project intended to advance Indigenous social equity. It runs throughout the Fellowship year and is designed to complement and build upon the five subjects of the Master of Social Change Leadership, culminating in a significant research-based project proposal. The subject focuses on the role and impact of fellowship and collaboration to advance Indigenous-led social change. Fellows will create a project proposal designed to consolidate their learning and social change approach. This may be through the design and delivery of an experience or event, opportunity for collective thought leadership, platform for influence or independent scholarly research output."
