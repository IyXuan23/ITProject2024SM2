        "AIMSThis subject provides students with hands-on electronic skills to gain basic competencies in design and implementation of simple circuits. Students will design with a range of standard electrical and electronic devices, basic circuit construction methods and electrical measurement techniques to test and verify the function of electronic systems. This subject is one of four subjects that define the Electrical Systems Major in the Bachelor of Science and it is a core requirement for the Master of Engineering (Electrical) and the Master of Engineering (Electrical with Business).This includes hands-on experience with:\u2022 Operation and selection of electrical and electronic devices used in various electronic circuits;\u2022 Common electronic circuit realisations to meet the most commonly required signal processing and conditioning applications;\u2022 Programmable digital circuits and microprocessor programming;\u2022 Circuit design and simulation tools;\u2022 Printed circuit board layout, circuit assembly, and soldering techniques;\u2022 Test and Measurement equipment and methods;\u2022 Managing design issues and requirements.",
        "Students will complete electronic circuit implementation projects in small groups and be required to prepare technical documentation and present project outcomes.",
        "INDICATIVE CONTENT\u2022 Devices such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, switches, transducers, motors, diodes, transistors, op-amps, voltage regulators, comparators, oscillators, timers, A/D and D/A converters, microprocessors and controllers;\u2022 Circuit functions and techniques such as buffering, referencing, signal conditioning, filtering, bridges, detection, waveform generation, and pulse-width modulation;\u2022 Microprocessor programming, the role of assembly and high-level languages, assemblers, compilers and debuggers;\u2022 PCB layout, circuit assembly, and soldering techniques;\u2022 Test and Measurement methods and working with common equipment such as multimeters and oscilloscopes."
