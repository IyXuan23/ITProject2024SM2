        "In this subject students build on their proficiencies and skills in writing, reading, speaking and listening by engaging with authentic texts and situations, and are equipped with more sophisticated language and intercultural skills to converse about themselves in Hebrew within a broader range of social contexts. Students read a variety of texts such as newspaper and magazine articles, poetry, songs, short stories, films and debates in order to comprehend their complex meanings and write a variety of personal stories. They attain a more sophisticated level of language skills necessary to express their opinion and take part in discussions about culturally and politically significant issues and develop structures and vocabulary that enable them to communicate their ideas and opinions about larger social and cultural themes."
