    "aims": [
        "This subject introduces the basic methods of structural analysis and the design of simple structures which are built of reinforced concrete, steel, timber and masonry. A feature of this subject is the integration of the design and analytical skills in dealing with contemporary structures that have an effective blending of materials for achieving satisfactory performance and economy in construction.",
        "This subject consolidates basic structural theory and design abilities that underpin further specialised studies in structural design in engineering masters programs. It also gives students some basic capabilities to seek work experience in the engineering profession.",
        "INDICATIVE CONTENTTopics covered include: stress analysis in beams, deflection calculations using direct integration and virtual work methods, structural analyses of beams and frames by the force method, structural design of reinforced concrete beams and columns, design of pad footing, structural design of steel beams, columns and ties, design of timber joists and masonry squat walls."

In addition, students will undertake miniature experiments to reinforce materials covered in the lectures and also a design exercise which involves applying the learnt techniques in solving problems that are likely to be encountered in practice.INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCESStudents will have access to lecture slides, recommended reading materials. The subject LMS site also contain worked solutions for all tutorial problems.CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKSSenior practising engineers from industry will deliver some of the lectures and case studies with focus on typical industry design considerations.Having completed this unit, students will acquire skills to design and analyse simple structures."
