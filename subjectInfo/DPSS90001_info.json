        "The focus of this subject is on developing a theoretical and critical framework to contextualise design for the creative sector using research resources and methodologies.",
        "Historic and current precedents are examined from cross-cultural, interdisciplinary and contextual perspectives. Class activities include presentations by visiting practitioners discussing their philosophies and approach, as well as student seminar presentations.",
        "Students develop a working understanding of appropriate research methods, including practical experience in locating resources (local and global) for specific inquiries. Attention is given to the issues of research writing and editing as they apply to graduate research in the creative arts.",
        "This subject, if combined with the minor thesis option in Design Projects 3, forms a pathway to further graduate research studies."
