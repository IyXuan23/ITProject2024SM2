    "overview": [
        "This subject will address a selection of the most significant and cutting edge issues in the law governing public administration. Importantly the subject will take a contextual approach, placing administrative law principles in the context of the administrative processes they are designed to regulate, and considering the role of law in the design and working of government administration. It will seek to consider cutting edge issues in administrative law not only through the lens of legal analysis but also from the perspective of public officials, who are the addressees of and must work with administrative law principles. The subject will focus on the law of Australia and other common law jurisdictions.",
        "The subject is divided into three parts. Part one, on decision-making, will address the distinction and interrelationship between discretion and rules, including the use and legal status of government policy and official guidance; administrative procedures, including in terms of e-governance; and the place of good governance values in government rule-making, including values of transparency, accountability and participation. Part two, on judicial-executive relations, will consider government strike-back against judicial decisions, both in the context of judicial review and public authority liability, and the interplay between judicial review and government resource allocation. Part three, on \u2018new principles, new challenges\u2019, will critically examine and chart the implications for public administration of emergent doctrines such as proportionality, legitimate expectations and duties of consultation.",
        "The subject will be of interest to lawyers with interests in public law, and of especial interest to lawyers working in or who advise government, and to anyone with an interest in how law frames and operates within public administration.",
