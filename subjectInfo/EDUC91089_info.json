    "overview": [
        "This subject will develop and consolidate Teacher Candidates\u2019 understanding of major science concepts through examination of children\u2019s everyday experiences and application of the Clinical Teaching Model. Teacher Candidates will engage in rich problem solving and learn how to identify and utilise valid and reliable data, such that they develop teaching strategies that support students to engage in robust scientific inquiry capable of being critiqued by their peers. The teaching of inquiry teaching strategies will occur through the development of science pedagogies throughout the exploration and investigation of the science content areas of biological, physical, chemical, space and earth sciences and Science as a Human Endeavour. This subject references the Australian/Victorian Curricula.",
        "A major focus for the subject will be on developing Teacher Candidates\u2019 abilities to support students to undertake scientific inquiry. Teacher Candidates will be introduced to the 5E framework and develop and understanding of how to construct cohesive lesson sequences supporting student growth in science content areas. Throughout their workshops, students will work in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) and develop a deep understanding of the roles and responsibilities of PLCs when planning for Science. Throughout their exploration they will consider a variety of approaches for utilising inquiry as a pedagogical framework. Teacher Candidates investigate common science alternative conceptions and how to support students to realign their thinking. Teacher Candidates will further their ability to assess their students\u2019 by reading current best practice literature in the field of education and linking that theory with teaching when on placement in schools."
