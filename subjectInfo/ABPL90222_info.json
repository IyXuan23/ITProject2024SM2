    "overview": [
        "F_ Lab: Bespoke Furnituresis part of a suite of electives, the Digital Design and Fabrication Electives. In these electives students have the opportunity to build and demonstrate expertise and competence in the understanding and application of contemporary design tools that inform and shape design process and thinking. A Digital Design and Fabrication Electives are based on a culture of experimenting and making \u2013 applying contemporary design and making tools to create advanced physical and digital artefacts and environments. For more detailed information concerning the respective tutors, design approaches and previous examples as well as other offerings in the Digital Design and Fabrication Electives suite please check on the ADD+F Research Hub website under teaching and learning:https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/addf",
        "F_Labintroduces students to consideration of materiality, anthropometrics and fabrication techniques. Students will be exposed to and demonstrate the capability to use a wide range of making techniques, including e.g. skills in hand-tool usage and modern woodworking equipment.",
        "F_Labstudents will demonstrate their capability to design and fabricate a bespoke furniture piece that is highly individual and of novel aesthetic and material qualities. A resulting final piece will highlight students\u2019 experimentation process, demonstrate exemplary craft, and creating a novel furniture piece, e.g for one person to rest on.",
        "Costs to Students:",
        "In combination with prototyping and fabrication students should allow for a minimum of 100-200 AUD to cover material costs; costs often depend on students\u2019 choice of material.",
        "NOTE:This subject has a quota of 16.  See \u201cAdditional delivery details\u201d under \u201cDates and Times\u201d for more information."
