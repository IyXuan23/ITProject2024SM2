    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to key contemporary education debates that relate to secondary school policy. Through this subject students will analyse current education reform, and the debates that surround them, through careful examination of the relevant research literature. Students will develop key professional skills in research and policy critical analysis. Four main themes underpin the subject: 1) the relationship of schools to society, community and parents; 2) the role of school in preparing students for their future; 3) contemporary testing and standards reform; and 4) global and national neoliberal policy reform, including school funding, school markets, and choice-based reforms. Through studying different case studies of debates and reform students will consider the variety of issues that underpin schooling practice, research and polices. This will include engaging with key debates surrounding schooling and equity, global competitiveness, Indigenous rights, sexuality, notions of deficit, gender and disability and ability."
