    "overview": [
        "The subject introduces students to the theoretical perspectives and  skills relevant to the study and practice of urban design and planning. It builds a broad understanding of the ways urban designers and planners might successfully intervene in urban places, and gives students the practical means to be able to develop plans, policies and designs to improve urban places, and to achieve multiple objectives.Key skills for writing, drawing, urban analysis, design, and working at the scales relevant to urban design and planning, will be developed in a mixed suite of lectures, workshops, field trips, tutorials and studios. Students will analyse key readings and work on group projects for the semester that allow them to develop key skills including the production of a design for an urban place. Students will develop abilities in presenting, using a variety of media and in a range of settings.",
        "This subject will provide a lens on the University\u2019s Joining Melbourne Modules. These will be completed in parallel to the subject - unless already successfully completed. It will also support the Discovery goals for commencing students by introducing emerging concepts and research in the discipline area; ways to connect with the larger University community including peers, teachers and student groups; and awareness of academic expectations, and of wellbeing support offered at the University of Melbourne.",
        "Note:the subject includes a day-long field trip outside of Melbourne to a regional town and an outer suburb that will take place in the semester break week. Although the field trip is not assessed and is not compulsory, it is complementary to the final piece of group coursework \u2013 a strategic spatial plan for a choice of one of three localities for which you will in your groups sign up.",
