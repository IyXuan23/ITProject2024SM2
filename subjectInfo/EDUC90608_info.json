        "This subject focuses on identity and young people with an emphasis on the diversity of young people's artistic expression. It explores engagement with popular and traditional cultures and focuses especially on the diverse ways in which different groups of young people appropriate, invent and re-invent cultural expressions through the arts. Flexible delivery will provide students with the conceptual tools for understanding the role the visual arts, music and drama and related cultural activities play in young people\u2019s identity formation both in and out of school. It will examine creativity and engagement in the arts for, by, with and about young people in a range of educational and community contexts. Learning will be reinforced by fieldwork and assignments linked to cultural site visits. \u200b"
