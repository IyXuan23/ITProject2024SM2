    "overview": [
        "The Integrated Design Studios focus on the successful union of architecture and engineering in building design. With strong involvement from consultants and clients from industry the studios provide an excellent opportunity to experience how design happens in practice in an environment emulating a design office. Students from both disciplines work together to develop building designs for real clients with a focus on sustainable practices, including zero carbon and renewable energy technologies. You will learn how to view design from both engineering and architectural perspectives and express ideas based in well-grounded, informed critical thinking. The studio includes basic building envelope and energy analysis components and engenders development of integrated design skills and understanding able to be employed in building designs in industry. Each studio uses a building typology specific to the industry client involved as a case study. Sustainable integrated design solutions appropriate to the building typology in question will be researched and developed throughout the studios."
