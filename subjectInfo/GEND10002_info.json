        "What is the relationship between gender, globalisation and identity? How do we analyse the numerous structural forces and categories that shape both personal and collective identity politics? This subject investigates the relationship between globalisation and identity formation. It will focus on how categories of difference\u2014especially gender, race, and class\u2014dynamically connect across a range of contemporary events, such as labour migration, refugees, the climate crisis, religious revivalism, global aid and international development. Attention will also be paid to social movements that address feminist and decolonial concerns such as climate change, #metoo and #aidtoo, and indigenous sovereignty campaigns. What insights does an explicitly feminist lens bring to these complex formations and transformations? The subject will introduce students to intersectional and decolonial feminism, a range of perspectives of feminists of colour, and critical race and critical development studies."
