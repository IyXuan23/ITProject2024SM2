    "overview": [
        "This subject will bring together knowledge of students about speech pathology practice, and apply this beyond the direct clinical encounter. Students will be supported to understand and design interventions that build capacity in communities, to support people with communication and swallowing disorders. They will learn about models of working that incorporate people and groups beyond the immediate client- for example, with families, other professionals, and other services. Diversity and cultural safety will be a large focus in this subject, and students will engage with self and peer reflection around the development of their own practice in this area. In particular, students will be supported to identify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and to understand their role in providing culturally secure and responsive speech pathology services that take into account different ways of knowing, being and doing."
