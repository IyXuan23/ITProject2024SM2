        "This subject will highlight the significance of literacy assessment and teaching to meet the individual learning needs of primary school students.",
        "Topics will include: the social and cognitive factors that impact on primary school students\u2019 literacy development and a review of related research; the key role of assessment in profiling students\u2019 learning and the importance of targeted interventions in literacy.",
        "Teacher Candidates will undertake an analysis of a range of assessment practices used to identify the literacy needs of students, including diagnostic and standardised tests and the evaluation of various forms of work samples against state curriculum standards. They will investigate literacy teaching programs and approaches, differentiated for particular student groups within classroom contexts, which may then be generalised to curriculum implementation for improved outcomes more broadly."
