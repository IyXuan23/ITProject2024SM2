        "This subject introduces multi-disciplinary conceptual frameworks for understanding mental health and illness in young people and highlights the importance of social and environmental contexts for mental health. Using a social-ecological model, this subject explores contemporary facets and experiences of youth mental health across communities and systems. With a focus on emergent research, and including interviews with young people, students will be expected to engage reflexively and critically with various foundational biological, psychological and sociological concepts, and to develop an understanding of the factors that impact young people's lives and mental health. The subject encourages students to develop an evidence-based understanding of the diversity of needs and adaptive opportunities possible in their youth-focused professional contexts, with a particular focus on health, youth justice, welfare and education systems."
