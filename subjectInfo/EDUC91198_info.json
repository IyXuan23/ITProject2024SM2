    "overview": [
        "In this subject, students negotiate and undertake a research project related to education, with assistance from an academic supervisor. Through lectures, asynchronous work and supervision time, students are supported to develop a deep understanding of a theoretical and/or professional issue of concern in education. In consultation with their academic supervisor, they will further develop the research proposal that they designed in EDUC90419 and implement this research project. Students will conduct their individual projects, present and interpret their results and discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings from their research project in oral and written forms. Through this process, students will develop critical reasoning and thinking skills the ability to critically appraise education research debates and practices and the ability to conduct original research.",
        "The assessment tasks support the development of the skills required to conduct academic research; present findings from original research; and situate those findings within a relevant field of research.",
        "Please note that students cannot undertake research projects that require individual Human Research Ethics approval."
