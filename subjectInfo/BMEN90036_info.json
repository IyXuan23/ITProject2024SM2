    "overview": [
        "This subject will cover the physics of fluids, with a special focus on biologically relevant fluid flows. This includes the flow of bodily fluids in biomedical testing devices and in therapeutic systems. Students will study fundamental fluids mechanics principles and develop an understanding of the mathematics that describe them. These principles will then be employed using computational approaches in real-world applications for fluid mechanics, including pipe flow, microfluidics, pumps and rheology."
