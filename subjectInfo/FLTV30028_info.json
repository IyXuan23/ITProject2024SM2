        "This subject enables students to gain knowledge of business practices involved in pursuing a career in screenwriting. Through workshops and presentations, students engage with industry professionals to develop an understanding of opportunities and potential pathways within the industry.",
        "Students develop a personal strategic plan for engaging with the industry, with reference to their own creative projects and career objectives. Students assist in creating a graduate work \u2018showcase\u2019 intended to introduce them, and their work, to the industry.",
        "As a major component of this subject students choose to undertake either an Industry Placement or an Industry Research Project that prepares the student for a career within the entertainment industry.",
        "Optional Placement",
        "Students who choose an industry placement will be expected to find a screenwriting relevant attachment for 60 hours minimum. All placement details must be approved by the placement coordinator.",
        "Travel",
        "This subject has an optional placement component that could include travel. Students may travel within Greater Melbourne, Victoria, interstate, or overseas for their placement. All required travel during the placement must comply with the Student Travel and Transport Policy.",
        "Alternately, students who choose an Industry Research Project will nominate an area of research relevant to screenwriting and write a contextualised paper interrogating their area of inquiry. Either choice will require students to demonstrate a high degree of self-motivation and is expected to require similar input and hours."
