    "overview": [
        "This subject involves case studies of biotechnology innovations that are hindered by a barrier of significant public distrust, the prime example being genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Newer biotechnologies such as precision gene editing may face analogous barriers. This subject explores (i) the scientific context of such controversial innovations, (ii) social implications that may restrict them from making a beneficial contribution to society, and (iii) strategies needed for successful deployment."
