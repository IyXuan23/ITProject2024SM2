        "This is a subject suitable for students taking life science and biomedical subjects. It offers an introduction to the techniques used in many areas of molecular science.",
        "Students taking the course will develop practical skills in the laboratory and an understanding of the techniques used in biochemistry and molecular biology to investigate biological problems.",
        "Students will develop practical and research skills by exploiting the physico-chemical properties of molecules in a variety of experimental techniques, and interpreting the data they generate.",
        "Students will apply these skills to the:",
        "separation and characterisation of proteins; and",
        "isolation, manipulation and characterisation of nucleic acids: and",
        "examination of cellular structures.",
        "Students will develop key scientific communication skills required to report on their practical work; as well as learning to relate theoretical principles to practical observations.",
        "Online lectures will cover the theory of these standard laboratory techniques central to biochemistry and molecular biology and new methods driving the fields of genomics and proteomics."
