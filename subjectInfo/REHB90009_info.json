    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to innovative and contemporary technology that has been recently developed and is currently used in clinical practice and research for the purposes of measurement, diagnosis and prescription. Students will be exposed to theoretical principles and practical applications of selected technologies. Students will critically appraise selected innovation and emerging technologies using a scientific approach in order to consolidate their understanding of the key elements that determine feasibility, safety and utility. This will develop an understanding of the processes involved in integrating innovative and emerging technologies into their clinical practice to provide information that is measurable and meaningful to their patients, healthcare insurers and providers. Students will be required to develop a proposal for implementation of an emerging technology to measure human performance or functional outcome. Moreover, students will explore existing or emerging platforms (e.g. hardware) and infrastructure (e.g. resources) that are required to support such an endeavour.",
