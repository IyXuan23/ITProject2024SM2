    "overview": [
        "This foundational subject explores the purposes of education and the role of the teacher in meeting professional ethics and responsibilities. Education has the capacity to transform society and through this subject, Teacher Candidates will examine the social, political, and legislative conditions that create schooling cultures to support and sustain all students. Teacher Candidates will consider how local and global educational policies inform and are informed by educational practices. This subject references the relevant Australian educational frameworks and curricula.",
        "The clinical model of teaching will be introduced as an evidence-based practice guiding teaching, assessment and  evaluation approaches. Teacher Candidates will examine current research into the processes and strategies that facilitate learning and will gain knowledge and understanding of physical, social and intellectual development and how characteristics of students may affect learning. Specifically, pedagogical practices will focus on understanding and responding to the learning strength and needs of students from linguistic, cultural, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds.",
        "This subject will also support Teacher Candidates\u2019 exploration of classroom communication and management practices and strategies that support students\u2019 wellbeing and safety to provide high-quality learning environments that meet school and/or system, curriculum and legislative requirements. It will equip Teacher Candidates with the fundamental skills necessary to begin to observe, design and implement teaching strategies to engage all students.",
        "This subject includes a Clinical Teaching Practicum (placement) in a Secondary school. During the placement, Teacher Candidates will begin to demonstrate the nexus between theory and the practice of teaching, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research to support their teaching practice. Teacher candidates are supported by experienced Clinical Specialists and Mentor Teachers. A series of seminars will be held which explore Candidates\u2019 developing professional knowledge, practice and engagement."
