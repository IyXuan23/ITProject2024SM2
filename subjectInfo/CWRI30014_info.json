        "Advanced Screenwriting draws upon a variety of contemporary examples of screenwriting, including writing for film and television, and a range of genres. Students will develop an understanding of how contemporary screenwriting practices and ideals relate to shifting cultural and technological contexts. Through practical workshops, students will enhance their techniques in writing for film and television series, developing a creative project from pitch to screenplay. This subject builds upon skills learnt in the second year Creative Writing subject Writing for Screen."
