        "This subject provides students with the opportunity to apply their disciplinary knowledge to a team-based practical project related to their chosen specialisation (TESOL, Language Testing, English Language). Students will gain experience in co-designing and conducting a project, teamwork, and project evaluation. They will develop professional writing skills relevant to producing project proposals and reports, and professional presentation skills relevant to communicating project goals and outcomes to different stakeholders."
