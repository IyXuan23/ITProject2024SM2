    "aims": [
        "Engineering Technology and Society introduces students to the impact engineers have on society through the development and application of new technologies to solve large scale challenges facing society. This is achieved through a mix of a design project, interactive workshops and lectures with hands-on testing and analysis. This subject centres on the engineering method, the approach to problem solving and engineering design that makes engineers unique. The subject will prepare students for an exciting and rigorous engineering education that will allow them to serve an increasingly complex society.",
        "This subject features designing a solution to a real-world challenge relevant to the environment, energy or health using skills from areas such as fluid mechanics, water treatment, image analysis and online sensing. The exposure of students to emerging technologies is critical in the training of engineers for a modern workforce, especially in developing computer literacy in solving engineering problems. Students will gain experience with appropriate software tools for engineering calculations and simple logic structures as well as 3D computer aided drawing to empower students to 3D print components to test and refine your design solution."
