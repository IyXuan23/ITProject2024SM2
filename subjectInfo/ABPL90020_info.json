        "In this subject, students will learn about the theory and practice documenting historic buildings for purposes of research and conservation. Students will develop critical approaches to architectural recording and representation. The subject will offer experience in manual techniques and digital technologies, including photogrammetry and 3D laser scanning, and explore their applications in contemporary architectural and cultural heritage practice.  Skills will be developed through a focus on case study buildings, with students working individually and collaboratively to produce archival quality documentation and measured drawings of culturally significant urban heritage.",
