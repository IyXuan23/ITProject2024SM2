    "overview": [
        "The corporation is a key institution in the global economy. How corporations are owned, controlled and governed, however, vary across jurisdictions.",
        "Our subject explores the problems corporate governance must solve, and the different solutions proposed by contemporary corporate governance theory. In particular, we investigates the different strategies Asian jurisdictions take to maximise efficient and responsible corporate governance practices.",
        "Comparative corporate governance scholarship is dominated by case studies drawn from the Anglo-American experience. Yet Asia \u2014 the fastest growing economic region in the world  \u2014 offers important contributions to this literature. With diverse legal traditions, market systems and institutional histories, Asia does not constitute an archetypical \u201cmodel\u201d of corporate governance. Students will explore how this diversity complicates longstanding positions in comparative corporate governance theory.",

        "History of corporate governance failures and scandals, especially in Asia;",

        "The Anglo-American, European and Australian models of corporate governance;",
        "The key Asian models of corporate governance, such as the Japanese, Chinese, South Korean, Singaporean and Indian models; and",
        "The debate over the globalisation of corporate governance systems."
