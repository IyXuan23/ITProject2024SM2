    "overview": [
        "Along with the globalisation and the development of constitutionalism, comparative constitutional law has become an important subject in the field of constitutional research.",
        "Comparative constitutional studies focus not only on constitutional texts but, more crucially, on constitutional politics. Issues including unconstitutional constitutional amendments, abusive constitutionalism, constitutional remedies and governance, and the judicialisation of politics have become extremely popular among students of comparative constitutional law. Even for those that focus on constitutional texts, new research methods, such as large-N empirical legal studies, have been adopted.",
