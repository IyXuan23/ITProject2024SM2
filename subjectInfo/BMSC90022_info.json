    "overview": [
        "In health, metabolic function involves the integrated operation of all body systems to ensure that metabolic fuel supply is attuned to the fuel usage requirements of every organ, tissue and cell. In metabolic disease, the integrated operations of the primary fuel supply regulator (liver) and the major energy consumer tissues (especially heart and skeletal muscle) are disrupted. Metabolic disruption is the basis of major global health burdens - including diabetes, obesity, heart failure, and cancer. In this subject Researchers will lead discussions to introduce students to the paradigms of metabolic research, examining how questions can be formulated to drive knowledge forward and how different models and technologies can be used to generate translational outcomes."
