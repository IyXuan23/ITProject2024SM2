        "This subject covers anatomy, functional anatomy and neurophysiology of the pelvis and its contents, with particular emphasis on the pelvic floor muscles and fascia, micturition and the urinary tract. Types of incontinence and diagnostic procedures are discussed and physiotherapy assessment and management of different types of incontinence are studied theoretically and practically. Pathology of connective tissue and its relationship to prolapse, and surgical procedures in gynaecology are studied theoretically. The use of electrotherapy for diagnosis and treatment is included. An introduction to evidence based practice and computer database searching are provided."
