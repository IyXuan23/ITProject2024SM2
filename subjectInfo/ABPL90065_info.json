    "overview": [
        "This subject investigates the concept of the global city region as a source of issues that require new approaches by planning decision-makers. It does so by establishing the way that global city regions can be identified, how they are shaped by economic and social forces, and in turn how their planning agenda requires new and innovative ideas and approaches.",
        "The subject draws upon international experience in the development of the concept and in the illustration of the outcomes, but at critical stages the subject will refer to Australian examples. Successful learning in the subject will involve an effort to get to know and understand the character and planning issues confronting metropolitan areas that experience global city development forces and students are encouraged to read widely about cities, drawing where possible on web pages of planning agencies to capture recent policy debate."
