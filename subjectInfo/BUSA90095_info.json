        "This subject addresses the foundations of valuation and financial management. The subject is based on the traditional principle that firms should be managed to increase the wealth of their shareholders, subject to the fulfilment of their contractual and legal obligations to other stakeholders. Some concepts addressed are also relevant for all organisations, as well as for personal financial planning and investments. Key concepts addressed in this subject are the valuation of financial assets (e.g., shares) and selection of investment projects."
