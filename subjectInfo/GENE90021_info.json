        "This subject will introduce students to the principles of genomic variant classification, interpretation and reporting in a clinical setting.  Students will apply these principles together with foundational concepts of human genetics and genomics to model clinical practice using examples from specialised areas of clinical genomics.",
        "The intended learning outcomes for this subject are in accordance with the Human Genetics Society of Australasia\u2019s core competencies for training in genetic counselling. The subject will be delivered via a combination of asynchronous on-line content and synchronous tutorials that adopt a problem-based approach to meet the intended learning outcomes.",
