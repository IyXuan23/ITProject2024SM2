        "Service Navigation is a new paradigm influencing and changing the delivery of health and human services. Responding to the current trend toward client-directed care across various sectors this subject will introduce students to the field of service navigation including the context that gave rise to the field; the shift from the \u2018passive recipient of care\u2019 to the \u2018engaged partner in care\u2019; the application of the role in public and private settings; and, the practice fields in which service navigation is both established and emerging. It will provide students with a framework of the key principles and practice elements of service navigation including engagement and mobilisation of service systems, working with individuals and families across the life course, and costing, contracting and service agreements. This subject aims to strengthen their capacity to deliver high quality and effective services in existing service navigator roles and to provide a theoretical basis from which service navigation can be evaluated, expanded and developed."
