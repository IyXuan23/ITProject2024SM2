        "Merger & acquisition activity is a mainstay of the growth characteristics of large firms. It has been a feature of business life for well over a century. Whilst there have been many merger \u2019waves\u2019 over the years, this pathway to growth has constantly maintained its importance. This subject begins with an examination of the history of, and reasons for, merger and acquisition activity thereby providing a rationale for the study of the whole of the merger & acquisition process. This process extends from the decision to acquire through to the means of achieving successful post-merger integration.",
