    "overview": [
        "This subject facilitates learning of head and neck anatomy. Topics include the development of tissues and structures from embryonic stages through to completion of growth, and the functional aspects of anatomy such as occlusion. Learning is supported by a range of medical imaging modalities, including microscopic features and 3D technologies. The development and morphology of permanent and primary teeth are studied, along with the relationship between structure and function. Basic neuroscience knowledge required to support the practice of dentistry is also covered."
