        "This Capstone subject provides students with a grounding in approaches to political and policy research and translation. It focuses on developing students\u2019 abilities to think clearly with data, to understand and apply different types of quantitative and qualitative reasoning and to better understand questions of causation that are at the heart of many political science and public policy questions and debates. Students then apply these skills to a policy area of their own choosing (which could cover anything from local politics to foreign affairs). This subject prepares students for further study and/or entry into the workforce by strengthening skills in policy analysis, making arguments in a logical and fact-driven way, working collaboratively in teams, and communicating effectively to different audiences"
