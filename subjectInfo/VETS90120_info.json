    "overview": [
        "Using clinical cases to illustrate principles, this subject examines the structure, function and potential for dysfunction of the digestive system of the major domestic animal species. As students develop an understanding of the mechanisms of disease of this system, they will develop skills in the clinical evaluation of it and in the interpretation of relevant diagnostic procedures."

        "Explain the processes by which normal function of the digestive system may be disrupted and predict the outcomes of perturbations",
        "Apply an understanding of the mechanism of action of common classes of drugs that act on the digestive system to explain their use in the treatment of digestive diseases",
        "Work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and apply an understanding of the structure and function of the digestive tract in order to analyse and interpret clinical problems related to this system in animals"
