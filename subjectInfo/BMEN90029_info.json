        "This subject aims to develop students' knowledge and capabilities in experimental and computational biomechanics of cells and soft-tissues. Students will apply fundamental mathematical theory of nonlinear continuum mechanics and computational approaches to solve stress-equilibrium equations. Students will learn fundamentals in cell signalling and how cell- and sub-cellular-level processes affect cell and tissue mechanical properties. These concepts will be put to practice in project-based and examination assessments."
