    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the nature and structure of attitudes. We will examine how attitudes are formed, when and how they can be changed, and whether attitudes predict behaviour. We will explore emerging issues of implicit attitudes and the debates around implicit attitude measurement. We will also examine how attitude and behaviour change research impacts real world situations such as prejudice and discrimination, consumer behaviour, and social issues such as smoking, healthy eating and exercise initiatives."
