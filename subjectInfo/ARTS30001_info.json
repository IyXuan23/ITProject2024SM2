Students will engage with industry collaborators and asked to manage real concept proposals. They will work in teams to recommend potential avenues for improvement, refinement or evaluation of an existing project or concept idea that is identified or deemed of interest by the industry collaborators. In small teams students will present the results to an audience of industry specialists, clients and peers. Students will be exposed to the rigour of processes undertaken in the industry. Seminars will incorporate team building activities, business strategies, communication, time management and knowledge of organisations, workplace culture and career pathways.",
