        "This subject will cover the modelling of a range of physical systems across multiple domains as ordinary differential equations, and then introduce the mathematical techniques to analyse their open loop behaviour.",

        "Development of low order models of a range of electrical, thermal, mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic dynamic systems",
        "Different representations of these systems (time and, frequency domains) and transformations between them (Laplace, Fourier and Z-transforms)",
        "Representations of systems \u2013 transfer functions, Bode plots, state space, block diagrams, etc",
        "Identification of linear time invariant systems (least squares identification)",
        "Relation to time domain properties of open loop responses \u2013 stability, oscillations, etc.",
        "MATLAB will be used throughout the course to complement the presented concepts.",
