    "overview": [
        "In recent decades, the rate of technological innovation in financial services has accelerated, posing new challenges for regulators and regulated financial services firms around the world. This course will provide a brief introduction to the existing technologies and business models used by established financial services firms and the regulatory framework that applies to them, before examining how new technologies and new business models are transforming financial services around the world. Different law reform strategies adopted by regulators in different countries will be assessed, as will business strategies of regulated firms to accelerate their rate of innovation. As national regulators confront the challenge of protecting local consumers in global markets, they may respond by collaborating with other national regulators, with extraterritorial enforcement of their laws, collaboration with private regulators, or ceding the terrain to private regulators. Although cryptocurrencies, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies may receive the most media coverage, many other case studies of disruptive 'FinTech' innovation and its regulation in both advanced and emerging economies will be examined.",
