        "This subject is designed for students who have successfully completed Japanese 1 or those who have similar experience. In this subject, students will establish basic Japanese literacy in order to be able to engage in social events and situations in an appropriate manner, while drawing on their background knowledge in their first language. Students will be introduced to around 100 new kanji characters. They will develop communication skills required to deal with giving and receiving information on people, places and events based on personal experiences. Students will also learn to engage in transactional activities such as requesting and offering, and responding to those. Students will develop literacy to communicate in Japanese effectively through basic narrative writing by recounting. In addition, students will develop intercultural understanding through identification of common Japanese rituals and routines, reflecting on their own culture and comparing between them."
