    "overview": [
        "This subject (Research Project B) provides students with the opportunity to design and conduct, under supervision, independent research in biomedical science, building on the work completed in Research Project A. Students will take responsibility for a research project, including the design of field and/or laboratory experiments; collection, appropriate statistical analysis, and interpretation of data; and oral and written presentations of the results. The report describing the research will more closely resemble a scientific paper than a traditional thesis. Students will assimilate and critically evaluate new knowledge within a scientific paradigm and communicate that knowledge to others. Students will also develop skills in managing a scientific research project, writing scientific reports, providing and responding to peer reviews, and making an oral presentation. Students will identify an appropriate supervisor and project as part of the application process for the Master of Biomedical Science (MC-BMEDSC).",
