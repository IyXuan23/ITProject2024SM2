    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on the studio practice components introduced in Studio Studies 4, with an emphasis on advanced investigative and experimental working processes towards the development of a focused area of enquiry. Students will implement a high degree of conceptual aesthetic and practical ability in their work and establish a consistent self-directed studio practice.",
        "Through individual studio tutorials and forums, students will consolidate the ability to articulate and discuss their work and the work of others in a contemporary visual art context.",
        "The Professional Practice component introduces students to the analysis and synthesis of their chosen area of enquiry through writing workshops, discussions and industry-based exhibition and grant applications. Students will develop regular visual artwork practices through application of effective time management strategies and maintain established foundations of sound occupational health and safety practices."
