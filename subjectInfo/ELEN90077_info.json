    "overview": [],
    "aims": [
        "This subject develops a foundation for pursuing electrical engineering oriented research in the area of sustainable energy systems. This subject aims to introduce the concepts behind smart grids, future low-carbon energy networks, sustainable electricity systems as well as the main renewable and low-carbon generation technologies. The subject will introduce students to tools and techniques so that distributed energy resources (e.g. distributed renewable generation, storage, electric vehicles, demand response, etc.) may be integrated effectively into the power system in the context of both traditional grids and future smart grids."
