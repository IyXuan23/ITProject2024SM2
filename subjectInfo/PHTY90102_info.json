    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to integrate core strands of physiotherapy knowledge and practice with contemporary health needs of individuals, communities and populations. Aging populations, changing technologies and changing expectations of the health workforce mean that physiotherapists are required to be both responsive and adaptable in practice and research. This subject broadens students\u2019 understanding of how physiotherapy knowledge and practice can apply to chronic illness and disease stages. Theories of illness and disability relevant to chronic conditions in specific populations, ages and gender will be studied. Critical examination and critique of models of health practice that arise from these underlying theories and their application to specific case studies will be addressed."
