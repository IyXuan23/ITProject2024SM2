    "overview": [
        "This subject encourages students to reflect on how journalism has changed over time and to consider what it might become in the future. It examines the emergence of what we now call \u2018journalism\u2019 and looks at the technological, political and economic issues that shaped its development. Students will engage with key theorists and formulate their own informed opinions about the rise of news, the nature of journalistic objectivity, the relationship between journalism and democracy, and the threat (or promise) of Artificial Intelligence.",
        "From the emergence of citizen journalism and the struggle for diverse journalistic representation to the nature of combat reporting and the rise of social media, the subject links historical debates with the controversies of today \u2013 and invites students to think about the journalism of tomorrow."
