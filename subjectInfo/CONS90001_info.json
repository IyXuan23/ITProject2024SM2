    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces three key management systems used in the construction industry, namely Work Health and Safety Management Systems (WHSMS), Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and Quality Management Systems (QMS). It aims to provide relevant practical knowledge and skills to help manage projects to comply with specific safety, environmental and quality standards, codes and regulations. This subject endeavours to develop your knowledge and understanding of the processes and activities involved in preparing a Work Health and Safety (WHS) Plan and Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) in accordance with the relevant Work Health and Safety legislation; a project-specific Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to manage environmental performance and conformity with environmental management policies, practices, and project specific environmental conditions; and a Quality Management Plan (QMP) in accordance with Australian and international standards. Major topics covered include management principles, models, and tools related to these three management systems."
