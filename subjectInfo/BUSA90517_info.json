        "Students work in syndicates as consultants to social entrepreneurs, who are creating a business plan and sales pitch to obtain external funding. Syndicates work through the entire consulting process from receiving the client brief, negotiating the final terms of the consulting project, executing the negotiated consulting activities, and delivering and presenting a final report to the client. The consulting activities will require students to apply and integrate the knowledge, skills, and attributes acquired throughout the MBA program."
