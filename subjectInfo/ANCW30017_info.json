        "The remains of the Ancient World continue to intrigue. Ancient texts, art and archaeology play an important role in our society today and have done so for many centuries. The visible and invisible foundations of the sciences, the arts, architecture, political systems, urban life and economic exchange of the West are to be found in the Ancient World.",
        "In this subject, students draw on their experiences in studying the textual and material remains of the civilisations of the Ancient World and learn to reflect critically on the role of ancient cultures and heritage in the 21st century. Students work with strategies suitable for communicating the Ancient World, and learn to address their audiences to create an impactful message through a medium of choice."
