    "overview": [
        "This subject further develops and consolidates Teacher Candidates\u2019 mathematical content knowledge and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge for effective teaching and learning of Mathematics in Victorian Primary Schools. The content focus is Measurement and Geometry, and Statistics and Probability using the four proficiency strands from the Australian/Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks and Curricula. Teacher Candidates will consider research evidence related to selected key issues of teaching and analyse the development of key concepts. They will consider typical conceptions and misconceptions held by children, their likely causes, diagnostic tools to diagnose them and teaching strategies for changing them. They will examine cognitive an affective characteristics of mathematics classrooms that encourage deep learning in these content areas.",
        "Teacher Candidates will reference Victorian and Australian curriculum documents and resources when planning sequenced lessons. Teacher Candidates will learn to critically evaluate mathematics programs, materials and teaching methods. They will explore important pedagogical issues such as: selection of good examples, use of non-examples, representations of mathematical concepts and explore how to differentiate in the mathematics classroom and engage in the Clinical Teaching Model to target teaching to the needs of students. By widening their appreciation of exemplary mathematics teaching, Teacher Candidates are expected to develop reflective mathematics teaching practices."
