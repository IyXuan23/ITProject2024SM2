    "aims": [
        "This subject is an introduction to combustion theory and applications. In the first part we discuss combustion fundamentals, including thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, conservation equations, and application of these principles to solve simple flames and reacting flows. In the second part we discuss combustion engines and the combustion phenomena in spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines."

    "indicative content": [
        "Chemical thermodynamics and kinetics - flame temperatures, Gibbs free energy and equilibrium, chemical kinetics, combustion mechanisms of common fuels.",
        "Governing equations - mass, momentum, species and energy conservation for idealized reactors and simplified reacting flows.",
        "Flames - theoretical analyses of laminar flames, premixed flame (flame speed, quenching, flame stabilization), diffusion jet flame (flame geometry, conserved scalar, soot formation).",
        "Reciprocating engines - engine cycle analysis, turbulent combustion in spark ignition and diesel engines, cylinder-pressure analysis, pollutant formation and emission control, alternative power-trains and fuels."
