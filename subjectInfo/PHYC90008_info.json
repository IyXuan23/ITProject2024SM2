        "This subject introduces quantum field theory, the combination of quantum mechanics and relativity that explains the fundamental structure of matter and the physics of the early universe. The course has an emphasis on quantum electrodynamics. Specific topics will include an introduction to classical field theory, the Euler-Lagrange equations and Noether\u2019s theorem; the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations; the quantisation of free scalar, Dirac and vector fields; covariant perturbation theory, the Smatrix and Feynman diagrams; the computation of elementary processes in quantum electrodynamics."
