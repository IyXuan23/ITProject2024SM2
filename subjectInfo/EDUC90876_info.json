    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the mathematics pedagogical knowledge and skills needed for teaching students from Foundation to Year 6. This subject will use the current mathematics education research findings, the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics and the new Victorian Curriculum: Mathematics. The focus will be on the content descriptors for the three strands: Number and Algebra, Measurement and Geometry, Statistics and Probability, and the proficiencies: Understanding, Fluency, Problem Solving and Reasoning. Teacher Candidates will explore the ways in which students from Years 3 \u2013 6 learn mathematics, the structure of the mathematics curriculum, the attributes of effective mathematics teaching, and strategies to engage, support and assess student learning. Teacher Candidates will develop and improve their own mathematical knowledge, skills, understanding along with confidence with the concepts and operations required for problem solving and investigation, real world applications, and for effective teaching of mathematics."
