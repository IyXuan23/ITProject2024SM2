    "overview": [
        "This subject explores the role of marketing and consumption in a world facing significant social and environmental challenges. What is the role of marketing and marketers in climate change, digital privacy, or the obesity crisis? Does marketing actually improve consumers\u2019 wellbeing? Many \u2018ethical\u2019 consumers now integrate their concern for society and the environment into their purchasing decisions. And many \u2018ethical\u2019 brands now promote their social and/or environmental credentials. So, can we market and consume our way out of these crises? This subject will address the criticisms of marketing\u2019s role in sustainability issues, and then equip students with the strategic and ethical direction to respond proactively to the opportunities these challenges provide."
