        "The aim of this subject is to provide students with an introduction to urban traffic engineering and transport planning principles. General theory as well as analytical techniques for solving common transport engineering and modelling problems are presented. The key theme in this subject is how to improve the efficiency and sustainability of transport systems. This includes basics of traffic flow theory, simulation, and operation models, and understanding and predicting travel demand in urban transport networks. Behavioural choice modelling methods are used with real data from the Melbourne Metropolitan Area to predict demand for all modes of transport including public transport and non-motorised transport modes. The concepts of accessibility, efficiency and sustainability are introduced in the context of urban transport systems, and transport safety measures and best practices are also introduced."

            "Key learning and teaching methods include:",
            "Lectures and large-group discussion of core themes and concepts. These are delivered by academic staff members. Lectures draw on real world case studies, key policy reference points and the introduction and description of basic analytical procedures or calculations. Lecturers employ multimedia, public speaking, and Socratic dialogue methods. Two hours of lectures are offered for each week of the academic program.",
            "Engagement with required and suggested readings and information sources. Readings and information sources cover a mixture of policy documents, journal papers, online references and databases, government reports or guidelines, and other textual resources. Students are expected to undertake between 1-2 hours per week of reading and resource review to support concept acquisition and knowledge contextualisation, as well as to assist with execution of tutorial exercises, assignment work, and exam.",
            "Tutorial and tutorial exercises in smaller-group format. This approach includes classic Q&A and calculation exercises. Tutors are primarily drawn from the specialist lecturers (from both academia and industry) tutoring in smaller groups, on specialised topics, with reference to the weekly tutorial exercises. Roughly one hour of tutorial time is available per week of the program.",
