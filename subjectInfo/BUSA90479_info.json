        "This subject involves completion of an 80-100 hour work placement (which may be undertaken as part of a longer period of internship with an organization) integrating academic learning, employability skills and attributes and an improved knowledge of organizations, workplace culture and career pathways.",
        "The placement is supplemented by career workshops before and after the internship designed to introduce skills for developing, identifying and articulating employability skills and attributes and linking them to employer requirements. The placement is designed to draw on specific discipline skills associated with the Master of Business Administration course content. Internships are normally expected to take place after the core subjects of the MBA are completed. Placements must be approved by the Subject Coordinator.",
        "On completion of the subject, students will have completed and reported on a course-related project in a workplace. They will also have enhanced employability skills including communication, interpersonal, analytical and problem-solving, organizational and time-management, and an understanding of career planning and professional development."
