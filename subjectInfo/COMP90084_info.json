        "This subject will explore the fundamentals of quantum programming and quantum algorithm design. The subject will introduce students to a range of different quantum programming platforms and languages, and will include hands-on modules. The students will be prepared to write quantum programs, implement a range of simple quantum algorithms, such as Grover\u2019s and Shor\u2019s algorithms, and to execute quantum programs on a quantum computer through a cloud access.",
