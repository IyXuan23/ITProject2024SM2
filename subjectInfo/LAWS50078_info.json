    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces students to the domestic and international dimensions of environmental regulation. It develops and integrates legal knowledge from a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields (e.g. administrative law and torts law; environmental science and geography), augmenting this through study of specific environmental legislation and case law to build an understanding of the interactions that define environmental law. Topics addressed include the values the changes that found and confound environmental law including philosophical and Indigenous understandings of place, structures of environmental governance, modes and principles of environmental regulation, and the intersections of domestic and international environmental law. Case studies considered throughout the subject provide students with an understanding of recent developments in this dynamic area."
