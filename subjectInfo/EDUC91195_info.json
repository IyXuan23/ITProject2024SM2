    "overview": [
        "This subject provides an introduction to early childhood research (current and seminal) and the research design process. During the subject, students will read and critique early childhood research and connect this research to the elements of research design. Research memos through journaling will inform the creation of a self-study/ action research proposal. On completion of this subject, students will understand the landscape of early childhood research, research design, and have a research proposal ready for implementation.",
        "As part of the overall Graduate Certificate in Early Childhood Research course, students will participate in a Collective (small group of students) with a Collective Mentor (staff member/lecturer). The Collective serves as a consistent support for the student throughout the course and in relation to this subject."
