    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on how science contributes to environmental decision-making and management. Students will investigate how science from different disciplines is used and apply it to the process of environmental monitoring and assessment. Workshops associated with each module will emphasize practical aspects of how decisions get made in the face of scientific uncertainty. An individual capstone project will provide opportunities for in-depth critical thinking and analysis in an area of interest chosen by the student. By the end of the subject, students will have a scientific toolbox that they can use to solve real-world environmental problems after graduation whether undertaking further study or in the workforce."
