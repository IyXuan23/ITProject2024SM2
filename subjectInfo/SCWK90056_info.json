        "This subject introduces a number of approaches toprogram planningandevaluation, and highlights both practical aspects of the program design and evaluation process, and more conceptual or theoretical aspects. The subject focuses on macro social work interventions at the program/ organisational level. It includes how to develop new human service programs and/or how to modify existing programs to address identified needs. It further examines how to evaluate programs to assess if a program is meeting the identified needs and achieving intended outcomes. Each week of the subject focuses on a specific stage of the program planning/design process from needs assessment, program design, budgeting, implementation through to evaluation.  As part of the subject assessment students will design a new human service program and also develop an evaluation plan for the program idea they have developed."
