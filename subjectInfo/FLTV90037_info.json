        "In this subject, students will work collaboratively on a second graduate production in a selected genre on a narrative, documentary or animation short film, acting in a senior production role such as co-producer, line producer or production manager.",
        "Students will research and analyse the production processes relevant to their role, formally documenting their experiences.",
        "Students will critically assess the mechanisms and strategies for dealing with production-based challenges and interpersonal dynamics that arise in creating screen work. Self-reflection and evaluation of one's own and others' performance will enable recognition of alternative strategies, processes of improvement and critical evaluation of the producing and production process.",
        "This subject is the first part of a two-subject sequence, taught over two consecutive study periods. Students are required to enrol in FLTV90037 Production Collaboration 2 Part 1 (6.25 points) and FLTV90040 Production Collaboration 2 Part 2 (6.25 points), consecutively, for a total enrolment of 12.5 points.",
        "Students will receive a 'CNT' grade for Part 1. An overall result for the subject is given following completion of the two-subject sequence.",
        "Assessment, Subject Intended Learning Outcomes, and Total Time Commitment applies to the entire enrolments across Parts 1 and 2 of the subject.",
