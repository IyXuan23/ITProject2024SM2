        "This subject provides an overview of food packaging materials, processes and secondary packaging which has important roles in product preservation and safety, extended shelf life, consumer protection, sustainability and reduced carbon footprint, logistics and tracking, active packaging, modified atmosphere, marketing and other contemporary issues such as polymer and biopolymer technologies. The choice of material and processes involved are central to the functionality and cost of packaging. These are also the areas of most active development and innovation. A combination of lectures and manufacturer (within Melbourne and surrounds) visits will provide students with demonstrable knowledge of food packaging materials and processes. Some of the materials will be taught by industry experts."
