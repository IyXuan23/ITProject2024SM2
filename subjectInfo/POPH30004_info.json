    "overview": [
        "What makes a good health professional?  In this subject, students will explore and develop two central skills of health practice beyond technical expertise: ethical understanding and addressing social equity.  Marginalisation and disadvantage have long impacted patients\u2019 interactions with healthcare.  Substantial inequalities in health continue today shaped by social, structural, and commercial factors.  In this subject, students will learn about ethics and equity within the health sector, and the power of health workers to make changes when inequity has been entrenched into health systems and policies.  Students will investigate a range of real-world case studies to generate insights into good healthcare practice.",
        "The subject focuses on humanities and social science reasoning and impactful written communication. Overall, this subject encourages students to consider health beyond a focus on the individual body to encompass an ethical perspective grounded in community and societal factors.",
        "This subject would be appropriate for any student planning a health professional career or other work in the health sector."
