        "This subject will introduce students to the complexity of the human genome, and tools used by genetic counsellors to access information and inform risk assessment. Students will apply these tools in examining the molecular basis of single-gene and mitochondrial genetic diseases, including diseases caused by chromosomal imbalances and rearrangements, and autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, sex-linked, and triplet repeat disorders.",
        "This curriculum is based on the genetic knowledge requirements of the Human Genetics Society of Australasia (HGSA) Board of Censors for Genetic Counselling, which governs the certification of genetic counsellors in Australia. The course will be delivered via a combination of on-line content and case-based face-to-face tutorials."
