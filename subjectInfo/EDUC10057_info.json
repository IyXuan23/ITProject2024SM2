    "overview": [
        "This subject explores the science of what enables individuals to operate at the peak of their potential, including the conditions that are thought to give rise to optimal motivation, emotional agility, resilience, and other factors that support wellbeing and performance.",
        "The subject will explore skills and pathways for cultivating wellbeing while giving consideration to relevant individual differences and cultural factors. The content draws on a variety of disciplines, including psychology, education, philosophy, sports science, and organisational science, to enable students to apply this in their own context.",
        "Students will learn about the historical and philosophical views of wellbeing, motivation, and performance; the paradigm shift from problem-focused to strengths-based approaches; and the evolution from individual- to system-level perspectives of what contributes to wellbeing.",
        "Throughout the subject, students will design a personalised wellbeing intervention plan that is grounded in evidence-based practice, that they can apply in their own life."
