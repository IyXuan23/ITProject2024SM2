    "overview": [
        "This subject will consider how professionals can better understand ways in which people with autism and those identifying as Autistic interact with and experience the world, and how that impacts on engagement and learning. The subject unifies research from neuroscience, psychology and pedagogy to create a multidisciplinary evidence-base that reflects the science of learning. This will be used by students in conjunction with an intervention model of tiered response supported by the Ziggurat Model for Autism Intervention. Educators will combine this foundation with their expertise to develop a sustainable intervention framework tailored to a community of learners that is both responsive and rigorous."
