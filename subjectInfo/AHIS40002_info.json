        "This subject engages with the growing number of texts about Indigenous art and by Indigenous artists and scholars. It introduces students to the history of writing about Indigenous art in Australia, examining key publications, exhibitions, events and innovations. The theories and methods of Indigenous art histories are discussed alongside issues of intellectual property, copyright and cultural protocols. How have Indigenous art histories previously been written? What changes are currently taking place in the field? What international comparisons can be made and what insight does this bring to the changing discipline of art history?"
