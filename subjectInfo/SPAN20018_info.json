    "overview": [
        "In this subject, students will continue to develop their linguistic and cultural competence in Spanish. They will also advance and reflect on their skills in textual analysis, with a special focus on the long tradition of testimonial texts (testimonios) in recent Spanish and Latin American history. Through the study of first-person narratives and authentic Spanish and Latin American short films, news and shorter literary texts, students will learn how to create and use authentic Spanish and Latin American cultural materials across a variety of media based on academic research. This will allow them to produce their own first-person testimonies and critical arguments in the shape of both formal (project presentation, essay writing) and informal contexts (personal blogs, podcasts, videos, etc.). Students will thus gain an appreciation of, and an ability to express their own ideas about the cultural and historical realities that have shaped the Spanish and Latin American modern and contemporary world and recognise idiosyncratic differences within the Spanish-speaking communities. They will become confident in the use of vocabulary, sentence and text structures utilised in different contexts (formal and informal) and as presented in different newspaper genres, diaries, short and long narrative texts, and audio-visual expressions of the self and the other. In addition, students will enhance their digital literacy and practice skills as well as a number of skills relevant to a workplace environment, such as problem-solving, teamwork, clear communication, project presentation, information literacy and professionalism.",
        "",
        "Part of the assessment of this subject will contribute to the ePortfolio students develop in their Spanish and Latin American Studies subjects. This digital platform offers the opportunity to showcase relevant workplace skills and digital and intercultural competencies in the target language, as well as individual interests and ideas."
