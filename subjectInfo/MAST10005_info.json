        "This subject extends students' knowledge of functions and calculus and introduces them to the topics of vectors and complex numbers. Students will be introduced to new functions such as the inverse trigonometric functions and learn how to extend the techniques of differentiation to these. Integration techniques will be applied to solving first order differential equations.",
        "Differential calculus: graphs of functions of one variable, trigonometric functions and their inverses, derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions, implicit differentiation and parametric curves. Integral calculus: properties of the integral, integration by trigonometric and algebraic substitutions and partial fractions with a variety of applications. Ordinary differential equations: solution of simple first order differential equations arising from applications such as population modelling. Vectors: dot product, scalar and vector projections, plane curves specified by vector equations. Complex numbers: arithmetic of complex numbers, sketching regions in the complex plane, De Moivre's Theorem, roots of polynomials, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra."
