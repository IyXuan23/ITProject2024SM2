        "This subject seeks to build on the skills developed earlier and enables students to advance in their learning of Hebrew language and culture by studying an array of text and discourse forms that enhance the understanding of formal structures and the contemporary varieties of idiomatic and conversational language.  Students will learn advanced language and complex sentence forms through textual analysis, essay writing, oral presentation, the viewing of audio-visual materials and in-class discussion. Academic skills are enhanced through learning how to write scholarly essays in Hebrew and to do close readings in a variety of genres, including analysing and understanding such materials as short stories, poetry, and film."
