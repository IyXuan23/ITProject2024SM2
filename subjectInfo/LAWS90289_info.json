    "overview": [
        "A focus on comparative consumer law is both an interesting and important topic in light of global and trade connections between countries. We take a transnational, comparative approach to consumer law challenges and regulations across four countries \u2013 Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. Students will be required not just to understand the legislative regimes associated with these jurisdictions but to take an analytical, comparative approach to the content.",
        "This subject will provide a broad overview of the consumer protection regimes in these four countries. It will cover some specific topics in more depth including: identifying who is a consumer, an overview of general shopping protections, consumer credit legislation, online protections, remedies and enforcement.",
        "This will be of interest to anyone who works in a consumer-facing industry (as well as people who like to shop in any of the relevant countries!).  The subject is designed around developing knowledge, application and inter-personal skills. There will be a participation component and an in-course group presentation. Students will get guidance and support for how to develop the relevant skills before and during the subject teaching period.",
