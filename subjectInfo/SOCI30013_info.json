        "This subject will give practical tips and hands-on experience for designing and implementing social surveys, for both academic purposes and the public/business sector. The structure of the subject will parallel the steps taken when executing a survey: comparing the advantages and disadvantages of surveys versus other means of collecting social data; determining the specific purpose of the study and to whom the study applies; developing the content and testing questions; implementing the questionnaire; and undertaking data cleaning and preliminary analysis. This will be illustrated by drawing on experiences from real life surveys. Practical, hands-on exercises will form a key part of lectures and tutorials and computer lab exercises."
