        "This subject examines collaborative dramaturgies through the rehearsal and collective authorship of a devised performance project. The subject draws on critical and theoretical understanding of dramaturgy to apply it as a tool in devising live performance.",
        "Students will translate a given stimulus into a studio-scale work-in-progress performance through research, design, documentation and practical investigation. Reflection on practice is used to develop a dramaturgical analysis of collaborative working processes in a written assessment."
