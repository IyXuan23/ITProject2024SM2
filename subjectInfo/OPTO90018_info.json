        "Semester 1"
    ],
    "overview": [
        "This subject will train students in a diverse range of core research methods utilised in the Department of Optometry and Vision Sciences. Each of our laboratory heads will deliver a special seminar explaining the operation of a particular research method, and demonstrating how it is applied to solve contemporary problems in their field. Together these seminars form a core curriculum in the vision and ophthalmic sciences, considered vital to training the best and brightest new researchers. Students will summarise, describe and apply what they have learnt in each seminar by preparing short video presentations, as well as an in-depth essay extending upon one of the topics. Students will interact with lab heads to receive feedback on these assessments to maximise development of their scientific communication skills. At the end of the subject, students should be able to describe the principles underlying each method and how to apply them to solve research problems."
