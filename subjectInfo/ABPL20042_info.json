        "This subject was formerly known as Residential Construction and Structures.",
        "A major portion of the general public has aspirations for home ownership and this continues to drive the residential market in Australia. This subject provides an introduction to residential and multi-unit residential low rise construction systems with an emphasis on materials selection, usage and construction methods. The various structural systems and design concepts currently in use are incorporated and interlinked into all the topics, which include an introduction to footing, floor, wall and roof framing systems and their compliance with Australian Standard Codes. The structural considerations include the analysis of loads, load paths, lateral stability, timber column and beam design for strength and stiffness, and general beam behaviour and statics analysis. The issue of materials technology, its application and performance are incorporated throughout the lecture series leading to an awareness of building pathology and maintenance. The subject also provides an introduction to residential services."
