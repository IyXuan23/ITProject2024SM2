    "overview": [
        "Mind, Brain & Behaviour B (MBBB) is a 12.5-point subject equivalent to PSYC10004 Mind, Brain and Behaviour 2. It is taught entirely online in an intensive format in the second six weeks of semester 2. It can be taken in conjunction with Mind, Brain & Behaviour A (MBBA) which is a 12.5-point subject equivalent to PSYC10003 Mind, Brain and Behaviour 1 that is taught entirely online in an intensive format in the first half of semester 2. MBBA and MBBB can be taken together in succession within the same semester. Doing so would allow a student to enter the Psychology Major mid-year and complete all the first-year requirements of the major within semester 2. Alternatively, students can complete all the first-year requirements of the Psychology Major by taking PSYC10003 Mind, Brain and Behaviour 1 then MBBB. Students may not take both MBBB and PSYC10004 Mind, Brain and Behaviour 2 as these subjects cover the same content.",
        "The purpose of MBBB is to continue the introduction to psychology started by MBBA. It discusses some basic issues in human development and complements this with an examination of the nature and development of personality and human interaction in social groups and cultural settings. It also considers how people interact with their environment and discusses what the consequences are, both when this interaction proceeds smoothly and when it does not.",
        "It covers the following five topic areas: Human Development; Social Psychology; Personality Psychology; Clinical Psychology; and Quantitative Psychological Research Methods.",
        "Students are given the opportunity to develop and apply a range of fundamental skills in areas of critical thinking, psychological research methods, and communication of psychological knowledge. The subject is designed to raise significant questions, prompting students to think about their own individual experiences and the experience of others. Students are introduced to the tools used in psychology to find answers to these questions. A common research-centred framework is adopted, and the methodological and statistical tools that support this framework are introduced and developed as an integral part of the subject.",
        "Although the online modules for this subject will be released all at once, they are designed to be studied in a progressive fashion and students will be encouraged to work through them at a constant rate, in sync with the weekly e-tutorials, which have been designed to support these online modules. Weekly quizzes will help ensure that students stay up-to-date with the modules and on track to achieve the desired learning outcomes."
