        "This subject introduces the science of positive psychology. Students will critically examine the historical development of the field, distinguish amongst different conceptualisations of wellbeing and flourishing, and develop a foundation in core constructs that contribute to and support wellbeing and resilience. The subject focuses on scientifically-sound processes and techniques, with the aim of helping students to become critical consumers of the literature. Interactive sessions and assignments will help students engage with, and begin to apply wellbeing science in their context and provides a strong foundation for subsequent subjects."
