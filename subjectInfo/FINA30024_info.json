        "This is the capstone subject for the Performance Design major in the Bachelor of Design, and will integrate previous coursework in the major. The core of the undergraduate sequence in the major is the development of both design thinking and dexterity with tools.",
        "The focus of the investigations of this capstone subject will be performance design, using a text (a play text, a piece of music, a piece of choreography, a soundscape) and a set of circumstances (the brief), which will be explored by students through the lens of two or more of the previous design studios. The project will involve an engagement with historical, theoretical, structural, and environmental ideas relevant to the text."
