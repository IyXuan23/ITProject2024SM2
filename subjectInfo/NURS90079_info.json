    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed to promote an understanding of the theoretical aspects of neonatal care to support safe practice in caring for neonatal patients. Students will explore the impact of hospitalisation on neonates and their families. A primary focus of the subject will be the assessment of the neonatal patient presenting with common neonatal conditions associated with preterm birth as well as the care of the sick neonate in the neonatal intensive care unit. This subject will explore neonatal transition, stabilisation of the compromised newborn,  respiratory diseases, congenital anomalies, peripartum hypoxia and common conditions presenting in the neonatal period. Student will focus on accurate assessment of the newborn and initiating infant interventions and family centred care at a beginning level of practice.  Evidence underpinning neonatal practice as well as the technical and scientific knowledge that is a pre-requisite for skill development will be explored throughout the subject."
