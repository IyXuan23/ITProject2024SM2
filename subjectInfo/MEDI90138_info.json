    "overview": [
        "After completion of this subject, students will have the knowledge and skill  to perform and interpret focused clinical ultrasound to identify the cause of common causes of shock and cardiac arrest (peri-arrest) and how to write an ultrasound report. The peri-arrest ultrasound examination builds on the extended focused abdominal sonography in trauma (eFAST) of the abdomen, heart, and lungs to include assessment of non-traumatic shock and cardiac arrest including cardiac dysrhythmia, ventricular function and volume, pulmonary pathologies other than effusion as well as diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs to assist in diagnosis of pulmonary embolus. Students will perform, interpret, write a report and submit a log-book of at least 15 peri-arrest studies on simulators and/or patients with a wide range of pathology and interpret and write a report on an additional 10 online peri-arrest ultrasound studies of a wide range of commonly encountered pathology causing peri-arrest."
