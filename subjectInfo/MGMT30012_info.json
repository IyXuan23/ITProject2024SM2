    "overview": [
        "Management Consulting is designed to provide students with an enriched learning experience. Working in cross-disciplinary teams, students will be assigned to a client organisation and will be required to draw on their prior knowledge gained from their studies to address contemporary business problems/opportunities at the individual (e.g. employee satisfaction, customer experience, etc), organisational (e.g. process analysis/improvement, organisational design, etc.) and industry/societal (e.g. industry analysis, go-to-market strategies, etc) level.",
        "Students will be supported by formal lectures that cover practitioner-oriented methodologies. The mastery of specific consulting tools and techniques will be achieved through skill-based workshops led by experienced instructors. Students will learn to work with unstructured and incomplete information, to develop research and networks to support their enquiry, to work successfully in teams, and to present their findings and seek and receive constructive feedback in a range of settings. Students will also be encouraged to plan, reflect and modify their approaches to improve the outcomes of their efforts in managing their business project."
