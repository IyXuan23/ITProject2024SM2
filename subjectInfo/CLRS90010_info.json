        "Data analysis methods are an integral part of modern clinical research. They are powerful techniques that enable researchers to draw meaningful conclusions from data collected through observation, survey, or experimentation.",
        "However, data analysis is a huge discipline with different paradigms, schools of thought and alternative methodologies. Therefore consideration of the appropriate methods used must be undertaken when designing a study and selecting variables and groups.",
        "This subject introduces students to the basic principles of qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques. It will provide a functional grounding in the theoretical concepts behind each type of analysis, as well as exploration of the interpretation of data and the difference, where applicable, between clinical vs statistical significance."
