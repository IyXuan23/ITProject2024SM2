    "overview": [
        "Students will gain a theoretical and practical overview of heritage conservation techniques. The subject will introduce students to the main conservation issues affecting built heritage in relation to both structural issues, as well as those impacting interior and exterior decorative finishes. Students will learn how to diagnose common conservation issues and explore the various treatment options available. Starting with a general discussion of built heritage conservation, students will then focus on specific issues associated with individual construction materials, including stone, metal, brick, wood, glass, and concrete. Lectures will be backed by laboratory sessions and fieldwork at heritage places across Melbourne to observe conservation issues in situ."
