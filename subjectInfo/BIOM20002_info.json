        "The subject introduces students to the organisation and function of the human body. General principles of anatomy, basic embryology and the characteristics of the major tissues and organs are covered. The concept of homeostasis, neural and humoral control systems and aspects of oxygen transport, digestion and metabolism, acid-base and fluid balance and temperature regulation are studied. Foundations of pharmacology, receptor-ligand interactions and principles of drug action are covered."
