        "This subject introduces students to Italian diction for singers.",
        "Students will acquire aural, oral and International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription skills, applying these to Italian-language vocal repertoire of the western classical tradition, with the aim of producing Italian speech sounds for singing with authentic prosody, efficient articulation, and meaningful communication. Differences between spoken and sung diction will be explored.",
        "Assessment is based on written phonetic transcriptions, spoken/sung performances, and revision of class content.",
        "This subject is primarily designed for classical voice students and for pianists interested in vocal accompaniment. Other instrumentalists are welcome to enrol but should be aware of the singing component of the assessment tasks."
