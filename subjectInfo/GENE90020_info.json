    "overview": [
        "This subject will provide an in-depth coverage of cellular and developmental genetics with respect to recent advances and insights. This subject will extend basic knowledge in these areas gained during a student\u2019s undergraduate degree with topics ranging from the molecular basis of gene regulation, genetic control cell function, developmental programmes of embryogenesis and their evolution, and the use of model organisms in biomedical studies. It will consist of blocks of lectures, literature review and analysis where published papers are analysed and discussed, and of student oral presentations. The subject provides students with skills and knowledge for understanding original research and enhanced written and oral communication skills. The course will be offered in alternating years."
