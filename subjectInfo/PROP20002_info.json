        "This subject introduces students to the basic principles and business concepts of Property, through examination of the underlying drivers of commercial Property Development and Property Investment, the underlying systems and relationships \u2013 social, commercial, political, economic and environmental - which govern the operation of property markets with particular reference to urban property in Australia. More specifically, the subject examines the nature of property, property and site analysis, the statutory planning process to obtain a planning permit, property market research, and relevance of these processes to development of financial modelling and examination of property productivity, profitability and financial performance. In addition, there is an examination of the participants in the property industry, their roles and how they interact. Topics include:",
