    "overview": [
        "Design Management has developed an increasingly important role within the construction industry since the development of new project acquisition methods from the 1990s onwards. These recognise the importance of the integration of the design and construction processes, the emergence of the project management profession as well as the more specialised role of architects and engineers. This industry role, to coordinate a team of people within a defined framework with agreed goals to achieve a desired design outcome, has evolved within various organisational settings such as architectural and engineering practices, project management consultancies and construction contracting companies. The organisation of the design effort to produce a set of deliverables that achieve the functional, financial and time requirements expected by the relevant key stakeholders is at the core of the design manager\u2019s role. This subject will investigate these roles and responsibilities within the different organisational environments and throughout the project\u2019s lifecycle. In addition, the unique stakeholder relationships and expectations of the design manager acting on behalf of the client, consultant or contractor will be explored and a design management plan developed for a contemporary commercial building project."
