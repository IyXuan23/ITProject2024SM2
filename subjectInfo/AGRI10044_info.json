        "This subject introduces students to plant science with particular emphasis on crop and pasture species. Students will gain an understanding of plant growth and development to achieve desired levels of yield and quality. This subject considers how crop and pasture canopies grow by acquiring resources from the environment, how plants allocate resources to different growth processes, and how management and environment (including climate change) affect plant production in Australia and worldwide."
