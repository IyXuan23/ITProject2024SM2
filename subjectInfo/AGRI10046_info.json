    "overview": [
        "This subject, which builds on concepts and knowledge introduced in AGRI10045 Foundations of Agricultural Science 1, aims to provide Bachelor of Agriculture students with an understanding of the underpinning enabling physical sciences, as they relate to agricultural systems. Concepts in physics, chemistry, mathematics and data management will be introduced in the context of the science of earth and soil, water and climate, and plant and animal biology. In particular, this subject introduces students to important underpinning principles in physics and chemistry, in the context of water, solutions, soils and cells. Topics include fluid movement and mechanics, solubility, precipitation reactions, redox reactions and galvanic cells, acid base reactions, salinity and conductivity. The chemistry of selected elements will be discussed in the context of both soils and cells."
