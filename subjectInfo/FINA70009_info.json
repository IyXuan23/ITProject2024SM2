        "Students prepare a refined study proposal appropriate to their studio practice. The program should provide a conceptual framework for development and incorporate a study plan for acquisition of the skills necessary to realise the projected work.",
        "Students are encouraged to consolidate visual experimentations and the conceptual framework in their developing practice. Guidance and assistance is provided through individual and group tutorials. Each student is assigned an Academic Advisor who is responsible for oversight of the student's progress.",
        "Individual Tutorials provide the opportunity for one to one critical discussion with staff regarding the formal, conceptual, personal or expressive bases of the student's work and its realisation. Group Tutorials encourages critical discussion and debate in a peer group situation where the individual's work provides the starting point for consideration of a range of issues surrounding contemporary art practice."
