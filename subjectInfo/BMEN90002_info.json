        "This subject introduces students to the basic mechanisms of information processing and learning in the brain and nervous system. The subject builds upon signals and systems modelling approaches to demonstrate the application of mathematical and computation modelling to understanding and simulating neural systems. Aspects of neural modelling that are introduced include: membrane potential, action potentials, neural coding, neural models and neural learning. The application of neural information processing is demonstrated in areas such as: electrophysiology, and neuroprostheses. Material is reinforced through MATLAB and/or NEURON based laboratories."
