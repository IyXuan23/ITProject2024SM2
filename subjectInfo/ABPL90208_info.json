    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on knowledge from Measurement of Building Designs (CONS20002) and Cost Management (ABPL90312). It comprises automated measurement and quantification for cost planning and documentation of commercial building works. Topics include: measurement of substructure; superstructure; reinforced concrete structures including frames, columns, beams and slabs; stair in steel and concrete; doors and windows in timber and steel including ironmongery; glazing; floor, wall and ceiling finishing; painting and decorations; measurement of mechanical and electrical installation for commercial buildings. It also addresses unit rate estimating and project pricing in depth. The subject uses 3D Building Information Model (BIM) as a platform for project pricing using CostX Software. Students will be introduced to 3D Building Information Modeling using Autodesk Revit Architecture Software or GraphiSOFT Software as well as model  analysis workflow with Solibri software."
