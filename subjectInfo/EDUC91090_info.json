The subject includes a focus on effective pedagogies for wellbeing education; strategies to cultivate positive teacher-student relationships; and use of proactive policies, practices and partnerships to advance student wellbeing. This subject references the Australian/Victorian Curricula.  This subject aims to explore how the Health and Physical Education curricula can be designed to help students understand health as a crucial enabler for learning and development from Foundation to Year Six.",
        "Teacher Candidates will learn to plan and teach lessons informed by the understanding that children\u2019s wellbeing from birth is both a prerequisite for and an outcome of learning. Emphasis will be placed on effective teaching and learning practices and partnerships in Health and Physical Education with a particular focus on student agency, questioning, critical thinking and communication strategies that foster supportive relationships and active skill building for children, as well as adults in their family and community are central to children\u2019s wellbeing. Teacher Candidates will consider how the wellbeing can be embedded with other curriculum areas and in contexts beyond the school classroom. They will explore the important role digital technologies play in transforming, restoring and sustaining their communities and will look at strategies for supporting themselves and their students to be healthy, active and well."
