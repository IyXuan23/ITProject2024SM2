        "assessing the strengths, weakness and biases of qualitative and quantitative study designs commonly encountered in the medical literature",
        "literature searching and critical appraisal of published scientific",
        "This subject provides individuals from medical and allied health professions (such as nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists etc) and others with a biomedical science-based background with a conceptual framework in research which is undertaken in clinical and medical settings.
