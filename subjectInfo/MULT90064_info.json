        "This capstone subject consists of a practice-based component and a classroom component. For the practice-based component, teams of students will conceive and complete a real-world project that applies knowledge learned within their program.  Projects will be completed under the supervision of the subject coordinators supported by Project Labs held every fortnight and include curation or arts management activities. For the classroom component of the subject, students will participate in the Industry Core, a series of seminars that examine current trends in the cultural and creative industries. As part of the classroom component, students will also conduct original research on an approved topic selected in consultation with the supervisor. The research project will be in the field of art curation or arts and cultural management as applied to a single art form or cross-art form projects such as festivals, multimedia projects or international exchange in the arts and will draw on theoretical study as a research framework."
