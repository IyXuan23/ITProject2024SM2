        "Design Visualisation: Digital Techniques forms part of the Digital Visualisation specialisation in the Bachelor Design",
        "This subject brings together practical know-how and critical thinking around the field of digital visualisations of space using industry standard software. Building on the digital representational and design skills acquired in the pre-requisite subject, students will learn the principles of colour, material mapping, lighting, composition, entourage, story boarding, rendering and animation techniques. Students will acquire new skills for building digital models, setting up \u2018cameras\u2019, adding \u2018entourage\u2019 (people, vegetation etc) with post-production across an ecology of software. The subject will be delivered through a series of lectures, specialist software workshop led by industry expert and tutorials. The outcome will be a portfolio of image rendering and animation positioned within a critical theoretical context of image-production in contemporary design practice. Concluding each lecture and workshop, students will be introduced to self-teaching modules that will enable further experimentation with media and techniques.",
