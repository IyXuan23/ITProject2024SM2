    "overview": [
        "This subject provides advanced knowledge and skills on the technological design, performance requirements, procurement, manufacturing and construction of building envelope systems and materials.",
        "Considering facades and roofing systems from start to finish of the building process, the subject gives insight on the specificity of the facade construction industry as a key agent of the design and delivery of contemporary projects.",
        "New knowledge is built from the properties and behaviour of materials commonly used in building envelopes (e.g. glass, metals, insulation, sealants) and the fitness for purpose of different fa\u00e7ade and roofing configurations, systems and products.",
        "Learning activities focus on detailed design and construction technology aspects informed by regulatory benchmarks and established design principles, including waterproofing, wind-effects, air-tightness, thermal control, fire safety, acoustics, durability and safety in operation.",
        "Industry perspectives are considered from the different standpoints of designers, head contractors, sub-contractors and specialist consultants by exploring facade-specific case studies in procurement, environmental performance, design management, testing, prototyping, fabrication, installation, defect prevention and building maintenance."
