    ],
    "overview": [
        "This subject continues the integrated and inter-disciplinary approach to the study of function and dysfunction of body systems in animals introduced in year one of the DVM course. Students will build on their prior knowledge of organ function and dysfunction as they learn about the normal structure and function of the haemopoietic, integumentary and immune systems. They will explore the mechanisms of dysfunction and disease of these systems, the use of diagnostic imaging and clinical pathology in the evaluation and diagnosis of disease, and the principles of pharmacology and therapeutics in managing dysfunction and disease. Students will further develop their scientific and clinical reasoning skills, and their communication and teamwork skills, through collaborative case-based activities, integrating their disciplinary knowledge to evaluate clinical cases with multiple organ perturbation."

        "Identify abnormalities of the integumentary and immunologic systems and explain the processes by which these occur",
        "Explain how elements of the innate and adaptive immunity combine to form a functional immune defence system, and predict the clinical manifestations of normal, inadequate or excessive immune responses in the setting of infectious and inflammatory diseases",
        "Apply an understanding of the mechanism of action of common classes of anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic drugs, to explain their use in the treatment of inflammatory and immune mediated conditions",
        "Work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and apply an understanding of the structure and function of the integumentary and immune systems in order to analyse and interpret clinical problems related to these systems in animals"
