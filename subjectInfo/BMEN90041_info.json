    "overview": [
        "The subject involves undertaking a summer-intensive research project requiring an independent investigation on an approved topic within one of the research groups in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. It is primarily intended for Master of Biomedical Engineering students. Each project is carried out under the supervision of a member of academic staff and where appropriate, a delegated co-supervisor from the research group. To enrol in this subject, the student must first discuss with and obtain approval from a potential supervisor.",
        "Through regular supervisory meetings, the students will be guided through the research process. This will include understanding existing literature; problem formulation; experiment design; data acquisition, analysis and synthesis. The emphasis here will be on attempting something novel, leading to new knowledge or understanding.",
        "It is expected that the Summer Research Experience subject will incorporate findings associated with both well-defined professional practice and research principles and will provide students with the opportunity to integrate technical knowledge and generic skills gained in earlier years."

        "1. Perform individual research tasks within a supervised project (guided research) and develop proficiency in the use of common research tools (literature surveys, data analysis, technical reporting and writing), and develop familiarity with some of the specific research tools relevant to the selected topic of research;",
        "2.\tCritically appraise the role of published research, precedent, prior art, patents, registered designs and standards in the engineering project",
        "3.\tDemonstrate proficiency in analytical, problem-solving, research and design skills, including those appropriate for sustainable development",
        "4.\tApply standard engineering project management tools",
        "5.\tIntegrate into the engineering research the professional ethics and responsibility considerations towards the profession and the community",
        "6.\tEffectively communicate the outcomes of various stages of an engineering and research project",
        "7.\tExplore and articulate the impact of the engineering research and design exercise in the wider community."
