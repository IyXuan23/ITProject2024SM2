    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to provide students with the necessary tools to: identify social and ethical issues of digital technology particularly artificial intelligence and reason about these issues; communicate concerns, or discuss ideas, from differing points of view; and ultimately build technology with awareness of, and respect for, inclusion and the responsibility that comes with building powerful tools. Not contemplating ethical or social implications of AI and other technological tools may open up unintended consequences and risks. Ethical dilemmas can also cause additional personal stress for individuals who lack the skills to think about them reflectively. For these reasons, the growing societal and ethical problems raised by artificial intelligence and other technologies have become a major focus of many organisations, including for start-ups, government, defence, and many corporations.",
        "Topics include:",
        "the history of artificial intelligence",
        "established ethical theories and concepts and their relation to artificial intelligence and technology",

        "accountability, explainability, and transparency of AI",
        "practical approaches and ethical frameworks for designing, developing and deploying technology responsibly"
