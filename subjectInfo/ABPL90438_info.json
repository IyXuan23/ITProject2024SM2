        "This subject challenges students to creatively compose and strategically organise space for a complex programme.",
        "A variety of independent studios will be offered for preferencing by ballot prior to the start of semester. Programmes and sites will vary and may include civic, urban, housing, institutional, community or commercial typologies in urban, suburban, or regional settings. Common to all studios will be medium to large scale buildings with complex briefs.",
        "Through a process of careful analysis of function, creative exploration of three-dimensional form and space, study of precedents, and application of contemporary design theories and techniques, students will be expected to develop architectural designs that demonstrate mastery over spatial organisation and experiential dynamics.",
        "Architectural designs produced by students will be expected to integrate selected spatial requirements set out in the National Standards of Competency for Architects (NSCA) and in the Building Code of Australia (BCA) and consider environmental and ethical impact.",
        "Students will be expected to communicate a complex design vision in a clear and professional manner"
