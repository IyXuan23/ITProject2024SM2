    "overview": [
        "Statistical models are central to data science applications. Modelling approaches such as linear and generalized linear models, mixed models, and non-parametric regression are developed. Applications to time series, longitudinal, and spatial data are discussed. Methods for causal inference and handling missing data are introduced."

        "Understand how to model dependencies in data such as those that occur in time and spatial domains.",
        "Pursue further studies in this and related areas, or to be work ready as an applied statistician or a data scientist."
