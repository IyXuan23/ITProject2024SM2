        "This subject provides a basis for students in the Digital Infrastructure Systems major to integrate and apply the knowledge they have gained throughout their studies to solve real-world problems. The students will work on projects to use knowledge of sensing, measurement, imaging, information system and information infrastructures. They will apply the acquired knowledge from their fundamental training and demonstrate an ability to design sustainable engineering projects. The subject will also provide ample opportunity for the students to gain experience and skills in how to perform a real-world, client-driven, interdisciplinary project, including important communication and organizational skills."

In the other half of the semester, workshops and tutorials will introduce specialist topics and skills that the students may need for their project work. Throughout the whole semester, practicals are run that offer students a dedicated time for getting together as a team. These practicals also offer opportunity for in-depth discussion with the lecturers of approaches students may choose or challenges they may face in their projects. Further, students are expected to self-organize project including time line and task management.",
