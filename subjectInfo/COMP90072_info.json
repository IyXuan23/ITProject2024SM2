        "The physical, social and engineering sciences make widespread use of numerical simulations and graphical representations that link underlying their theoretical foundations with experimental or empirical data. These approaches are routinely designed and conducted by researchers with little or no formal training in computation, assembling instead the necessary skills from a variety of sources. There is an art to assembling computational tools that both achieve their goals and make good effective use of the available computational resources.",
