        "This subject involves completion of an 80-100 hour work placement integrating academic learning, employability skills and attributes and an improved knowledge of organisations, workplace culture and career pathways. The placement is supplemented by pre- and post-placement classes, including a compulsory induction in Week 2 and compulsory sessions in Weeks 3 & 4, designed to introduce workplace culture and strategies for developing, identifying and articulating employability skills and attributes and linking them to employer requirements. The placement should draw on specific discipline skills associated with the course of enrolment. Pre-placement seminars will also include career development and planning, self-assessment, reflexivity and professional skills.",
        "Students are responsible for identifying a suitable work placement, by Week 1 of semester, with support from Student Programs staff. In the semester prior to your placement you should attend Melbourne Careers Centre's employment preparation seminars and workshops and access other careers resources to help you to identify potential host organisations (http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/careers/). You will need to commence your approaches to organisations at least 4 weeks before the placement. More information is available in the Subject Guide. Placements must be approved by the Coordinator. If you have problems finding a placement you should contact the subject co-ordinator.",
        "On completion of the subject, students will have completed and reported on a course-related project in a workplace. They will also have enhanced employability skills including communication, interpersonal, analytical and problem-solving, organisational and time-management, and an understanding of career planning and professional development."
