    "overview": [
        "This subject examines the role of thinking in teaching and learning. The aim is for students to gain both a theoretical understanding of the methods and strategies, as well as the practical ability to apply them. The subject aims to examine how thinking in schools articulates with the general capabilities in the curriculum, as well as asking how such capabilities affect educational equity and social justice. The background of a variety of educational approaches will be explored to clarify what teaching and learning thinking might mean. The approaches examined will be applicable across the disciplines and in different educational contexts. Beginning with the view that we teach thinking by teaching the skills and tools from various thinking skills programs the exploration moves on to more sophisticated and complex theories and approaches. Students will have the opportunity to participate in lessons based on these approaches and to apply them to individual educational contexts and interests. Students will leave with a deeper understanding of thinking, teaching and the education of thinking."
