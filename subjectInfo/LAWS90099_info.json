    "overview": [
        "The delivery of major infrastructure, energy and resources projects is an organic process which involves multifaceted interactions with the law. In this subject, students will gain insights into the way that advising on such projects involves navigating an often-challenging intersection of construction and regulatory systems, drawing on aspects of property law, environmental law, native title, finance, banking and commercial law.",
        "Students will also engage with the need for reform in major project delivery, with the cost of project delivery in Australia already prohibitive and globally uncompetitive.",
        "The subject will examine how major energy and resources projects are defined, designed, structured and developed, the pressure points for successful and cost-efficient project delivery in Australia, and the areas where conflicts and disputes emerge and how they are managed.",
        "Principal topics include:",
        "Project scoping from feasibility to design, including examination of recent studies on procurement practices and a simulated workshop on procurement models and how they respond to risks and opportunities",
        "Overview of regulatory approval frameworks and the social license for major project delivery, including a case study-based discussion of the interaction of such frameworks with construction document development and management",
        "Project delivery models and frameworks in the energy and resources sector",
        "Examination of leading causes of project stress and failure, including the need for proactive planning and strategies",
        "Interactive case study where students collaboratively examine particular aspects of project design and execution",
        "Current approaches to dispute management in major project delivery, including exercises examining common problems encountered in drafting dispute resolution clauses in project documentation, as well as a discussion of contemporary and innovative approaches to dispute management and avoidance in major projects."
