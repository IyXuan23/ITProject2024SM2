        "This foundational subject explores the purposes of education and the role of the teacher in meeting professional ethics and responsibilities. Education has the capacity to transform society and through this subject, Teacher Candidates will examine the social, political, and legislative conditions that create school and setting cultures to support and sustain all children. Teacher Candidates will consider how local and global educational policies inform and are informed by educational practices. This subject references the relevant Australian educational frameworks and curricula.",
        "The clinical model of teaching will be introduced as an evidence-based practice guiding teaching, assessment and evaluation approaches. Teacher Candidates will examine current research into the processes and strategies that facilitate learning and will gain knowledge and understanding of physical, social and intellectual development and how characteristics of children may affect learning. Specifically, pedagogical practices will focus on understanding and responding to the learning strength and needs of children from linguistic, cultural, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds.",
