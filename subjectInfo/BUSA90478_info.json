    "overview": [
        "This subject gives an overview of doing business in Australia, including an introduction to the Australian economy, history, culture and legal framework. Lectures, guest presentations, experiential exercises and site visits touching upon a range of sectors highlight key differences in business approaches and foci between Australia and other countries. Australian industries featured in depth include agribusiness, sport management and tourism. This subject will be relevant to anyone contemplating doing business specifically in or with Australia in the future, and to those who have a general interest in international business.",
        "Students are expected to have completed coursework in the functional areas covered in their MBA program\u2019s core curriculum (e.g., marketing, finance, operations, strategy), and to draw upon their professional and personal background outside of Australia in contributing to classroom discussion. Attire is casual for in-class sessions, smart casual for the corporate site visit, and summer comfortable for the MCG stadium site visit and optional excursions."
