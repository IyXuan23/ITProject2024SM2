        "This subject will provide Masters-level training in some of the fundamental skills that will benefit the subsequent capstone projects in the Master of Geoscience. In particular, you will gain experience of applied research methods in environmental geology, hydrogeology, engineering geology, sequence stratigraphy, and economic geology. You will build on the fundamental skillset that you developed in Practical Earth Science A, developing a solid foundation of skills and understanding in these areas.",
