    "overview": [
        "A big part of engineering is working out what problem to work on, as an important complement to knowing how to solve that problem.  This subject aims to give you theoretical frameworks, practical insights, and preliminary skills to do so.",
        "You will develop these understandings, insights and skills by working on two projects.  In the first, your multi-disciplinary team, supported by a mentor, will propose an innovation that helps a partner (industry, hospital, not-for-profit, start-up, the University) address a strategic challenge.  Through that project, you will learn the \u201cwhat and how\u201d of delivering innovation-like projects \u2013 understanding the relationship between your challenge and the organisation\u2019s strategy; designing, securing, and conducting interviews; analysing qualitative data to generate insights; ideation and creativity techniques to create value; stakeholder management; working in an intense team on an ambiguous problem; visual and oral communication.  In the second, you will develop the ability to apply to the same concepts to yourself \u2013 How will you know what you want and need?   How will you know if you need to change?  How will you innovate yourself as your interests, needs, and work world shift?",
        "We aim for you and your team to own your project and your learning.",
        "Creating Innovative Engineering (CIE) and its companion subject, Creating Innovative Professionals ENGR90039 (CIP), are delivered by the University's Innovation Practice Program. To learn more about the Program, including the range of organizations that have participated as sponsors, examples of past projects and to hear students talk about their experiences in taking CIE/CIP, please go to theInnovation Practice Program\u2019s website.",
        "All project sponsors will require that students maintain the confidentiality of their proprietary information.  The University will require all students (except those working on projects sponsored by the University itself) to assign any Intellectual Property they create (other than Copyright in their Assessment Materials) to the sponsor of their project. The projects may vary in the hours needed for a successful outcome.",

        "ILO3 - Collaborate, create positive relationships and productively shape group dynamics in highly uncertain professional environments;",
        "ILO4 - Have understandings and skills to work empathically with colleagues and clients who see the world differently from them;",
        "ILO5 - Apply understanding of how value is created in a multi-disciplinary professional context, and the importance of value creation, rather than just technical problem-solving, to professional work."
