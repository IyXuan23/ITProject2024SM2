        "Korean 6 is suitable for students who have successfully completed Korean 5 or who possess an equivalent level of Korean language proficiency. This subject prepares students to engage in academic settings in Korean. It trains students to communicate on a wide range of topics in history, political economy, society and technology. Students will refine their communication skills on discipline-specific vocabulary and functionality. Students will also broaden the grammatical understanding and applications of Hanja and technical terminology for academic performance. Through class activities, students will master to utilise various forms of multimedia and field-specific texts to grasp the specialisation of language function, practical translation and scholarly composition. In addition, students will develop interpersonal skills and cultural awareness to understand others and to present themselves appropriately in cross-cultural situations."
