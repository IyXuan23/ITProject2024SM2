        "Students enrolled in this subject will undertake a piece of research in arts management approved by the course coordinator. The research will incorporate both theoretical inquiry and primary research. On completion of the subject, students will submit a minor thesis on their chosen research topic. Enrolment in the thesis is across two consecutive semesters and students must enrol in the subject in each semester to ensure they are meeting the full 37.5 point requirement for the year-long subject.",
        "Students need to submit a research proposal at least 2 weeks prior to the semester of enrolment in the thesis. The subject coordinator can turn down the proposal (and thereby entry into the Minor Thesis) if the subject of the proposed Minor Thesis does not sufficiently align with the focus of the Master of Art Curatorship."
