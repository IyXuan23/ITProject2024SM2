    "overview": [
        "Through critical reading, observation and close analysis of practice or another arts-based learning context, students will identify the integral connections between the arts, engagement and learning. Students will explore the conditions that enable engaging arts experiences for children and young people and investigate the distinctive forms of knowledge that characterise engagement in the arts. Through reflection and research, students will synthesise and articulate how these are interpreted and evidenced, as well as exploring strategies for implementation and advocacy."
