    "overview": [
        "\u2018Clinical Assessment and Course Evaluation\u2019 considers the similarities and differences involved in judging the performance of clinical learners while also evaluating the education they receive. Whereas the foundation subject (\u201cAssessing Clinical Learners\u201d) focussed on the basics of the main assessment formats used by clinical teachers, this subject goes into greater depth on designing and implementing highly-performing assessment regimens. It also explores key issues in measuring the quality of health professional education programs and their associated assessments."
