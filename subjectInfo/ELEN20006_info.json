        "This subject develops a fundamental understanding of concepts used in the analysis, design and building of digital systems. Such systems form the information and communication technologies (ICT) that underpin modern society. This subject provides a foundation for subsequent subjects, including ELEN30013 Electronic System Implementation, ELEN90066 Embedded System Design and ELEN90061 Communication Networks."
