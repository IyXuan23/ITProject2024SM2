    "overview": [
        "The subject Healthcare in Context (HCC) 2 provides students with the opportunity to build their knowledge of the socio-politico-cultural influences on healthcare in a local and global context and to develop skills in health promotion. Students will draw on previous learning from the DPT program to design, implement and evaluate a community health promotion project.",
        "HCC2 will also build directly on the community engagement established in HCC1, in which students completed a community needs analysis and identified the health and wellness priorities of a community. In HCC2, students will use the findings from their needs analysis to design a project that meets one of the prioritised needs of the community.",
        "To support this project, students will cover the theory and practice of health promotion and the social and economic factors that support community health and wellness. Attention will also be paid to the health needs of Australian Indigenous peoples and the complexity of their health experiences within current local and global contexts.",
        "The culmination of this subject will be in a mini-Conference presentation, in which students will present their community project to their peers, academic staff and community members. Attendance at this final conference is mandatory.",
        "This subject, together with HCC1, is the capstone experience for the DPT program."
