    "overview": [
        "This subject examines theoretical principles of paediatric intensive care practice and integrates these with knowledge gained from Applied Pathophysiology, Foundations in Paediatric Critical Care and Paediatric Intensive Care Nursing. Students engage in work integrated learning in their individual clinical settings to build knowledge and skills to support comprehensive patient assessment across the lifespan from neonate to adolescence, and the management of technologically complex monitoring and patient care interventions. Patient and family perspectives of acute illness and disease will be considered in the development and implementation of nursing interventions as well as inter-disciplinary care planning. Students will gain essential knowledge to plan, monitor and evaluate nursing interventions as well as the knowledge of how to recognise and respond to medical emergencies, including patients who are at risk of clinical deterioration."
