    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the challenges and opportunities of interdisciplinary science education. It will provide the foundational knowledge needed to successfully teach, design and evaluate integrated curricula by focusing on research and best practice in interdisciplinary science education.",
        "The subject will explore issues at the level of the curriculum in relation to national policies, and at the level of the classroom, pedagogies and assessment. Relations between the sciences, mathematics, engineering, technology and arts (STEM or STEAM) and the balance between disciplinary knowledge and (generic) skills will be discussed. Also the broader societal context will be addressed: how can interdisciplinary science education contribute to the preparation of all students for future studies and careers?",
        "An important focus throughout the subject will be on what interdisciplinary science education might look like (units, projects, modules), and what purposes it might serve. The subject will take a particular focus on how to design, resource, implement, and assess STEM units."
