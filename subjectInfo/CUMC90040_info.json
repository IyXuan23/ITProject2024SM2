    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to the theoretical constructs and the practical applications that inform the profession and discipline of conservation. This subject explores conservation ethical issues, cultural considerations, policy frameworks and the economic environment and locates these within practice-led, treatment focussed classwork. The subject locates conservation decision making in the laboratory within a range of situated theories and practices that include community, laboratory, and museum and GLAM institution-based contexts. This subject develops haptic skills and knowledge in the handling and identification of materials and documentation of cultural material by enabling students to reflect on the strengths of aligning theory and practice."
