    "overview": [
        "This subject invites understanding of the heterogenous ground through which choreography as research takes place. Through a collaborative and constructive laboratory environment, students engage in choreographic practice and explore artistic identity in relation to the shifting roles of the choreographer.",
        "Workshopping the many possibilities opened by corporeal and conceptual engagements with contemporary movements, discourses, things, theories, technologies, histories, places and praxes choreography is understood as a form of lively address and an interdisciplinary practice.",
        "Students develop their working knowledge of dramaturgy and their capacities for observation, responsiveness and critical awareness in constructing self/peer review and feedback. This subject is delivered through intensive practical workshops, laboratory tasks, feedback sessions, seminars and tutorials."
