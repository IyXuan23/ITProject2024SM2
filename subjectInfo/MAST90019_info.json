    "overview": [
        "The subject covers some key aspects of the theory of stochastic processes that plays a central role in modern probability and has numerous applications in natural sciences and industry. We discuss the following topics: ways to construct and specify random processes, functional central limit theorem, Levy processes, renewal processes and Markov processes (discrete and continuous state space). Applications to modelling random phenomena evolving in time are discussed throughout the course."
