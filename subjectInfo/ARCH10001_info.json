    "overview": [
        "This subject builds a foundation for design by introducing students to the role of representation in contemporary practice. The subject\u2019s learning activities develop students\u2019 skills by teaching them to observe, document and analyse information using different media.",
        "Lecture materials introduce students to the conceptual background of representation and a broad range of representation techniques. The subject responds to the questions such as:",
        "Why do designers draw? and",
        "What is the role of representation?",
        "This subject teaches students to develop critical understandings of representational devices and techniques.",
        "Importantly, students use the ideas introduced through the lecture materials in practice. To do this, they engage with a variety of representational techniques that include orthogonal projection (by hand), model making, 2D vector-based drawing and 3D modelling using the software that is common in relevant industries.",
        "In the process, students learn to:",
        "manage data, information and representation workflows using multiple software tools;",
        "accurately represent spatial information;",
        "draw and model with care; and",
        "develop a critical eye.",
        "At the end of semester, students learn to integrate complex projects by designing and preparing their own portfolios.",
        "This subject also integrates with the University\u2019s Joining Melbourne Modules. Students can complete these modules in parallel with this subject, unless already completed. The subject also supports the Discovery goals for commencing students by introducing:",
        "emerging concepts and research in the discipline area;",
        "ways to connect with the University community including peers, teachers and student groups;",
        "awareness of academic expectations; and",
        "knowledge about wellbeing support offered at the University of Melbourne.",
