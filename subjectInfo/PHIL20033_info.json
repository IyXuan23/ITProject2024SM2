    "overview": [
        "Neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer science are making huge strides in modelling the human brain\u2019s information processing systems, from visual discrimination of faces to the neural circuitry and hormones that control our emotional reactions. But can these disciplines fully explain all aspects of our minds? Can scientific theories explain what it\u2019s like to smell the sea or to taste durian? Can they capture your appreciation of the meaning of a Shakespeare sonnet or the emotional significance of your favourite hip hop song? These questions continue to be hotly contested by both philosophers and scientists. Everyone agrees that human brain states are reliably correlated with our mental states \u2013 but are these mental states strictly identical to brain states or just causally produced by them? And just which aspects of our brains are correlated with states like beliefs, desires, emotions or sensations?",
        "In this subject, we examine the most influential philosophical answers to these questions. We start with Descartes\u2019 argument for dualism, which he claims provides indubitable grounds for thinking one\u2019s mind is not identical to any physical object. We then consider why scientifically minded philosophers resisted this picture and their attempts to say exactly which aspects of the physical world constitute a mental state. Is a mind just a disposition to behave in intelligent ways? Is it a functioning human brain? Is it like a computer program? Should our ordinary conception of mental states be rejected as scientifically ill-founded? Is it immune to scientific refutation? In the second part of the semester, we\u2019ll look in more detail at various mental capacities \u2013 for example, perception, imagination, emotion and belief \u2013 exploring the philosophical questions that arise regarding the nature and function of each."
