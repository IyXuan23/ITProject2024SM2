    "overview": [
        "The focus of Italian 5 is to assist students to further develop their understanding and competencies in relation to contemporary Italian language and culture. Through an intensive focus on reading of and listening to a broad variety of Italian texts, as well as the practical analysis and application of language use with a particular focus on representation of gender and inclusion, students will extend their linguistic capacities in reading, writing, listening, speaking and describing the Italian language. Students also explore aspects of contemporary Italian literature, society and history through a programmatic study of post-unification Italy. Students develop a critical capacity enabling them to understand and analyse a variety of text types (film, music, mass media, literature, etc.). Communication skills will also be developed through online and face-to-face collaboration in a range of in- and out-of-class activities, including a work-integrated learning group project which involves practical application of Italian language in a school setting."
