    "overview": [
        "This subject critically and creatively addresses questions of space, time and embodiment for the digital age through cultivating tools and know-how in digital literacy. It acknowledges that the primary way in which we engage with dance has turned towards the screen and digital media.",
        "Through workshops students experiment with various software, tools and equipment exploring the possibilities digital technologies offer in the development of new performance, modes of expression, dance making strategies, documentation and agency. Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Interactive Design are explored alongside Screen Dance. Students learn skills in tracking, framing, capturing, editing and virtualizing the dancing body.",
        "This subject will provide space for students to conceive of the choreographic and artistic possibilities of working with digital agents, produce digital dance artefacts and draw movement traces in virtuality. At the same time, it provides a critical context for apprehending dance in relation to the datafication and quantification of the body and digital surveillance."
