        "This subject introduces students to the use of the main translation-memory technologies, terminology tools, translation project-management programs and machine-translation postediting practices. Students will gain skills in the use of these technologies and will be able to assess critically their impact on cross-cultural communication, professional translation practice and additional-language teaching, where the technologies provide new learning environments. The practical activities can be carried out with any language paired with English, although demonstrations and examples will include the main European languages and Chinese."
