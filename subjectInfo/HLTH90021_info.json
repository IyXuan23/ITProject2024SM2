    ],
    "overview": [
        "This subject will offer students a foundation in developing a biomedical research discovery into a new therapeutic approach. In a series of workshops students will be introduced to the basics of research translation and the importance of data management and intellectual property strategy. Students will learn about the process and time scales involved in technology transfer and the challenges of transitioning from a research mindset into a development mindset. They will learn about the regulatory framework required to progress biomedical discoveries and the importance of project management, negotiation and relationship building with industry and government. Each module consists of a masterclass supported by webinars and print resources to deepen further the understanding of the topic."
