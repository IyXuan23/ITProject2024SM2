        "Learning in this subject is based around the examination of a number of use-cases for AI in the sciences, including such applications as data analytics, modelling, scientific discoveries and therapeutic devices. After conversations covering preliminary material on AI, Ethics, Law and Human Rights, these use-cases will be employed as basis for investigating the issues with particularly relevant themes drawn from the broader thematic domains.",
