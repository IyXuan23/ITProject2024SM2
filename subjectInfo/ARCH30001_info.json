        "Underlying the undergraduate design course is the development of both design thinking and dexterity with tools and techniques. The focus of this design subject will be on generating design ideas, translating them into architectural forms, spaces, materials and programs. Students will learn how to refine architecture through consideration of spatial organisation, environmental context and structural necessity. Students will also learn how to communicate comprehensive architectural propositions through 2D- and 3D-modelling (physical and digital), visual and written media and oral presentations. The focus in the design studio will be on issues of organisational sophistication and the consequence of planning. A critical understanding of how architectural design, planning and spatial order deal with the social, political and civic relationships that define a community, and how architecture transforms or assists (or resists) the transformations of these communities. Particular emphasis will be placed on awareness and critical appreciation of the consequential nature of architectural production, that is, how the control and use of architectural effects are a means of architectural production. The design studio focuses on complex buildings on sites with a development scope of up to 3,000m2. The designated site will be located within the urban or inner suburban area of Melbourne. The emphasis is on speculative undertakings.",
