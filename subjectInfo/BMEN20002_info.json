        "This subject introduces students to human anatomy and physiology relevant to bioengineering applications, including medical devices and technology that overcomes physical disabilities. Students will be introduced to anatomical terminology, the structure and appearance of cells and tissues, biomedical engineering technologies, quantitative measurements and experimental techniques used to investigate the structure and function of different tissues, organs and organ systems. The anatomy and physiology taught in this subject may include the musculoskeletal system, sensory systems, neural systems and the cardiovascular system."
