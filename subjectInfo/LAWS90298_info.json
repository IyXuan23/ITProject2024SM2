    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on Intellectual Property (IP) protection in the Asia-Pacific region. Fuelled by its rising geopolitical importance, the region presents a complex and evolving landscape for IP rights. In this subject we will undertake a critical and comparative analysis of IP laws across key economies like China, India, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries.",
        "Our analysis will encompass large, developed economies and smaller, developing ones. Furthermore, we will explore how recent trade agreements, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), alongside various free trade agreements within the region and with major players like the US and EU, are shaping not only the regional but also the international landscape of IP protection.",
        "Principal topics will include:",
        "Comparative IP Law: This will be the core focus, examining similarities and differences in legal frameworks for IP protection across key Asian economies. It will include patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and potentially other forms of IP.",
        "Impact of Trade Agreements: The subject will explore how recent agreements like RCEP, CPTPP, and various free trade agreements within and beyond the region (US, EU) affect IP protection in the Asia-Pacific.",
        "Emerging Issues: The subject will examine current challenges and opportunities in the region, such as IP enforcement, technology transfer, and the protection of traditional knowledge.",
        "Practical Applications: The subject will provide practical insights for practitioners seeking to advise parties who want to protect and commercialize their IP assets in the Asia-Pacific market."
