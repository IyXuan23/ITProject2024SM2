    "overview": [
        "In this subject you will conduct group-based, hands-on, original research into animal behaviour. Over the semester you will be immersed in the entire process of scientific research - from hypothesis development and experimental design, through to data collection and statistical analysis. You will report your findings in spoken and written formats, and critically review the work of other students. Study animals range from insects and spiders, to fish, birds and mammals \u2013 in the lab, zoo or wild. You will emerge with an authentic experience of scientific research \u2013 complete with its challenges, frustrations and the thrill of scientific discovery."
