        "This subject enhances students\u2019 language and intercultural skills in Spanish. On its successful completion, students will be equipped to describe emotions, places and people in a variety of ways. They will be able to communicate about the self and others through reading and writing personal stories and short critical texts. Watching authentic Spanish and Latin American short films and news as well as reading essays, short literary texts and newspapers from different Spanish-speaking countries will provide students with some in-depth knowledge about culturally and politically significant topics in the Spanish-speaking world and Hispanic cultures. They will become confident conversing in everyday informal and some formal situations, and they will showcase their communicative skills in an audio-visual group project producing a short video together. By the end of the semester, students will be able to use a variety of structures and vocabulary in the Spanish language including present and past tenses. Additionally, students will enhance their digital literacy and practice skills as well as a number of skills relevant to a workplace environment, such as problem-solving, teamwork, clear communication, self-evaluation, information literacy and professionalism.",
