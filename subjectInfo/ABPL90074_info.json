        "This subject was formerly called Advanced Landscape Technology.",
        "This subject links the creative, practical and technical aspects of landscape architecture design process to construction by developing knowledge and skills that translate and communicate design into the language of construction documentation emphasising the materiality and assemblage of hard scapes. The subject also introduces CAD as the graphic medium for documentation. Knowledge and skills are developed through a series of assessment components:",
        "A group assignment to critically review real documentation packages, conduct site visits and interview designers and present findings to their peers; and the main assignment of a landscape detail design and documentation project that utilises and synthesises skills and knowledge gained in the first two assignments and prerequisite subjects.",
        "The assessment criteria encourage the integration of ESD technologies in the detail design process and the development of CAD skills. The subject is delivered through a series of lectures, CAD intensives, and weekly design documentation tutorials, readings, site visits, interviews with designers and presentations.",
