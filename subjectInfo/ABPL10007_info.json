    "overview": [
        "The subject focuses on the basic principles and concepts of Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD) and tectonic design to develop design ideas and translate them into built form. Students learn about passive design strategies, structures, materials' physical and ecological properties, conventional and innovative construction techniques, and life-cycle issues to reshape the built environment.",
        "Through analysis, observation, experimentation, testing and review, students explore how design ideas can become environmentally sustainable buildings. They also explore how such buildings interact with natural environments and the inhabitants. Human comfort is discussed as a goal that should be achieved by considering the challenges and opportunities for the built environment to create a better social and environmental future."
