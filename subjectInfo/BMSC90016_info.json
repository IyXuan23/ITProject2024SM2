    "overview": [
        "Mammalian cells are the building blocks of our bodies, the foundries and factories of our medicines. With recent advances in gene engineering, cultured cells are no longer simply tools to study disease, but are a living therapeutic product. Pluripotent stem cells form a front-line to advances in cell manufacturing, as these can be engineered from cells cultured from any individual and in combination with gene therapy are forming the next generation of precision treatments for a range of diseases. In this subject, students will explore the recent and exciting history of cell and gene therapies, and develop a deep understanding of the foundational principles of growing, engineering, and scaling cells for successful manufacturing. Working with leading industry partners, students will work on real-life challenges facing the sector today, and will develop the essential attributes to design and manufacture the next generation of cell-based products."
