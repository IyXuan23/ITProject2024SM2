    "overview": [
        "Our human service and welfare systems have evolved to support us through life, from early childhood to old age. Yet the systems originally intended to support us often fail to address our real concerns; placing conditions on who can receive social support or managing our needs rather than enabling us to thrive. But how did these systems become like this, and how might they work differently? What do human service and welfare systems that grow people\u2019s capabilities look like? And how can we begin to shift the structures, power dynamics and mental models that reproduce social injustice? This subject equips students to critically analyse the effectiveness of human service systems and to understand the outcomes of welfare state spending, including unintended consequences, and the impacts on income distribution, inequalities, marginalisation, and different groups in society. Integrating conceptual and programmatic insights, this subject draws on contemporary policy thinkers, and harnesses the insights and expertise of professionals engaged in design, implementation, and evaluation, to provide students with the critical and practical skills necessary to drive systems change in their own work."
