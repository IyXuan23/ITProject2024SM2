    "overview": [
        "The subject allows students to conduct an original research project, under supervision to be approved by an academic project supervisor. The work will be equivalent to lecture and practical based subjects worth 50 points over two semesters. The content and extent of the project will be determined by a project supervisor, in consultation with the student and the Subject Coordinator, where necessary.",
        "",
        "Students are strongly encouraged to initiate project ideas within existing networks or to identify a project topic of keen interest, through discussion with Faculty staff, prior to subject commencement. The project represents a capstone subject and comprises a review of a body of relevant literature, together with a critical evaluation of research or experimental protocols, a modest original experiment, or limited exploration of a scientific problem, or an investigation into a problem using an approved methodology. Compared to the Minor Research Project, the major project requires deeper and higher-level analysis. Following an initial workshop to establish subject expectations, deliverables and skill base requirements, projects will generally involve regular meetings with their supervisor where students report on progress, difficulties and research plans. Other workshops will deliver skill development in oral and written report presentation."
