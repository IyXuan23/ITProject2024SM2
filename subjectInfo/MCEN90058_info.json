    "overview": [
        "Since the first industrial revolution, industrial engineering has evolved as a major engineering and management discipline, the effective utilization of which has contributed to our increased standard of living through increased productivity, quality of work, and improvements in the working environment. This subject is being introduced to offer students an overview of industrial engineering as well as its core principles and approaches, allowing a deeper understanding of the role of industrial engineers in society and organisations.",
        "This subject introduces concepts and most common approaches of industrial engineering, allowing students a wider view of their role. Topics covered are grouped in four modules: (1) history and fundamental concepts of industrial engineering; (2) principles and techniques of lean production; (3) facility planning and production flow design; and, (4) work measurement and ergonomics. A diversified set of classroom and industry activities help to consolidate the concepts and illustrate their applicability, preparing students for the upcoming subjects of the course and enabling a wider view of industrial engineering."
