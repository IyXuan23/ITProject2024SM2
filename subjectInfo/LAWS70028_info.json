    "overview": [
        "The rules governing international trade and investment are of great importance to almost every country in the world. Many legal relationships are necessary for goods to be traded from one country to another and for parties in one country to invest in another, and they are all predictably flavoured by the issues that arise when different legal systems interact. This subject gives an overview of the private international law issues that arise when goods are traded from one country to another, and considers the public international law issues that arise when governments try to influence the subject of international trade as well as the international and regional framework that exists for this purpose. The goal of the subject is to examine the international legal frameworks governing trade.",
