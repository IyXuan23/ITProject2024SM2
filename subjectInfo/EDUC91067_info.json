    "overview": [
        "In this subject biological, physical, chemical, space and earth sciences will be explored to enable Teacher Candidates to confidently integrate knowledge and pedagogy for science education in primary and early childhood settings. Young children\u2019s interactions with the everyday environment provide a starting point for applying the Clinical Teaching Model in early childhood science. This subject will develop and consolidate Teacher Candidates\u2019 understanding of major science concepts through examination of children\u2019s everyday experiences and application of the Clinical Teaching Model. Teacher Candidates will engage in rich problem solving and learn how to identify and utilise valid and reliable data, such that they develop teaching strategies that support young learners to engage in valid scientific inquiry capable of being critiqued by their peers. A major focus for the subject will be on developing Teacher Candidates\u2019 abilities to support young children to undertake scientific inquiry the science content areas of biological, physical, chemical, space and earth sciences and Science as a Human Endeavor.",
        "Teacher Candidates will be introduced to the 5E framework and develop and understanding of how to construct cohesive lesson sequences supporting student growth in science content areas. In addition, Teacher Candidates will examine the development of science process skills in early childhood. Throughout their exploration they will consider a variety of approaches for utilising inquiry as a pedagogical framework. Teacher candidates investigate common science alternative conceptions and how to support young learners to realign their thinking. Teacher Candidates will further their ability to assess their young learners\u2019 by reading current best practice literature in the field of education and linking that theory with teaching when on placement in schools. Similarities and differences between early childhood and primary pedagogies will be considered. Teacher Candidates will develop a strong understanding of the continuum of science learning and be capable of supporting a smooth learning transition across the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework and the Victorian Science Curriculum."
