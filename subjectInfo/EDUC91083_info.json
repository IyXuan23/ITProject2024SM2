    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on knowledge developed in the previous subject Language and Literacy: F to Year 2 to focus on teaching more complex aspects of language and literacy required in the middle and upper primary years.  Teacher Candidates engage with key research and theory to identify key challenges for teaching and learning language and literacy knowledge and skills in this transitional stage of schooling. Teacher Candidates will further develop specialised subject content knowledge for teaching and assessing student language and literacy development linked to the Australian/Victorian Curriculum: English. Teacher Candidates will extend their pedagogical knowledge of effective teaching strategies and assessment tools and of the Clinical Teaching Model to meet specific and diverse leaning needs.",
        "Topics include: reading comprehension, higher order thinking, critical analysis and inquiry around various written, visual, multimodal and digital texts; the importance of reading engagement, rich texts, and text selection; composition and production of complex texts central to English and other subject areas in both print and digital forms including multimodal; and development of academic language proficiency for reading, writing, listening and speaking across all subject areas."
