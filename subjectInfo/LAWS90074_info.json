    "overview": [
        "Copyright protection is the law\u2019s primary mechanism for providing incentive for the generation of creative subject matters (such as works of literature, art, music and film), and for regulating the use of such subject matters by others. Design registration is the law\u2019s primary mechanism for providing proprietary rights over the appearance of a mass-produced object. This subject explores in detail the law, policy and practice of the copyright regime, of the design registration system, and of the relationship between the two. The principal topics considered include:",
        "The international framework for protection of creative subject matters and designs;",
        "The subject matters capable of protection by copyright;",
        "The requirements for copyright protection to arise;",
        "The exclusive rights granted by copyright;",
        "The infringement, and the defences to infringement, of copyright;",
        "The subject matter of, and requirements for, design registration;",
        "The scope of protection provided by design registration; and",
        "The regulation of dual protection under copyright and design registration."
