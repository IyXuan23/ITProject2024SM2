To understand and be able to define the difference between strategic plans; urban planning schemes; urban design guidelines; urban design frameworks; urban character studies; urban design visions; site plans; landscape designs and architectural designs.",
        "To engage in a complex area of the metropolis and to analyse the existing fabric and represent this analysis in a clear graphic language at a range of scales.",
        "To be able to model urban form, building bulk, typology, sun-shading, topography, hydrology, public/private relations.",
        "To show understanding of urban spatial thinking that ranges from the scale of the street to the scale of the metropolis.",
        "To explore existing urban design theories and to focus on those effective in positively intervening with the contemporary metropolis.",
        "To investigate contemporary multi-disciplinary theories of form, space, order and aesthetics, and to test their relevance for contemporary urban design practice.",
        "To explore ways of representing the city in both two and three (perhaps even four) dimensional representations."
