    "overview": [
        "Director, Actor and Text builds on the knowledge and techniques specific to the discipline of directing for theatre introduced in Directing Methodologies and Dramaturgy, Text and Performance and Collaboration in Action, with a particular focus on the direction of actors with text.",
        "Through seminars, individual supervision and rehearsals, the subject explores the role of the director as part of a creative team, defining the skills, qualities and processes that are essential to the practising professional director.",
        "The subject comprises three distinct, but inter-related, modules: an intensive focused on approaches to text analysis and interpretation with actors; a workshop series in which text is explored on the floor in a scene study context; and a program of engagement with new writing in development. Underpinning these modules is a series of seminars conducted throughout the semester.",
        "The subject will examine text through a variety of lenses, each elucidating a particular aspect of directorial practice."
