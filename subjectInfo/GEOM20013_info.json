        "Digital infrastructure is critical for human development, for social, economic and political inclusion, resilience, and for a sustainable management of resources. At the core of digital infrastructure is the concept of location. \u202fClimate change can only be observed in relation to locations. Climate action in agriculture, environmental protection or urban planning relies on location, and the protection of life, infrastructure and properties in disaster response requires location. Renewable energy production and energy distribution is a spatial problem. The tracking of containers, parcels, and vehicles allows for efficiency to reduce resource consumption or emissions. The sharing mobility in the city is based on location information, and contact tracing is a matter of co-location. Digital infrastructure drives changes to the ways how information is formed or sourced, how resources are managed, and how complex systems can be successfully controlled or predicted. Practically each sustainable development goal of the United Nations requires digital infrastructure.",
        "This subject introduces students to digital infrastructure: How information is linked to location (or how location is information). The subject will transform the way how you understand and visualize our geographic environments in digital systems. In detail, this subject will cover underlying and cross-disciplinary concepts of geographically referenced information and geographic information systems (GIS), including the modelling and management of land-based and infrastructure data, and the visual representation of geographic information. It will relate these concepts to applications through case studies presented by industry experts from various professions. In parallel, students will design and realize a project on data integration, analysis, and cartographic representation to support multi-criteria decision making relating to climate adaptation, urban sustainability, or similar.",
        "",
        "Students who are not familiar with the software used in this subject are encouraged to make themselves familiar before the semester starts. Familiarity is a condition (a hurdle requirement) for this subject. LMS will provide pointers and material for learning on your own initiative in the pre-teaching period. Next to learning expert software, and learning how to use the software in a major project, the subject provides a systematic introduction to professional skills, and an active learning experience requiring attendance in person.",
