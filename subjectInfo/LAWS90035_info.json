        "This subject builds on the material covered in the Trade Marks and Unfair Competition subject. Trade Mark Practice focusses on the procedures and practices of the Australian Trade Marks Office in obtaining and maintaining registered trademarks. It covers the relevant aspects of New Zealand trade mark procedures and practice where these are different from those in Australia. Thus, this subject is particularly valuable for students wishing to prosecute trade mark applications through those offices. The rights, privileges and responsibilities of a patent attorney and a trade marks attorney are also covered in the wider context of attorneys\u2019 professional conduct. The lecturers in the subject have extensive experience in the obtaining of trade mark registrations and the subject meets the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board (TTIPAB) requirements for \u2018Topic Group B\u2019 and \u2018Topic Group D\u2019.",
