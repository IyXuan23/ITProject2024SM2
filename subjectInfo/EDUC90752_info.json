    "overview": [
        "This is the second of two subjects that Master of Instructional Leadership students complete as part of their [AQF] Capstone experience. Drawing on theory, knowledge and skills developed throughout the Master of Instructional Leadership students will implement an intervention or innovation designed to address an issue associated with instructional practice, or that will lead to improvements in teacher quality and student learning and achievement. As part of their project, students will be expected to document planning and implementation decisions, and also research the impact of the intervention on teachers and school students. The Capstone project will culminate with students synthesizing the findings of their research in a written form such as a journal article or report. A hurdle requirement for this subject is that students will also provide an oral presentation of their findings, which should incorporate a reflection on the key learnings and understandings they have gained from their studies in the Master of Instructional Leadership. This subject aligns with the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership National Professional Standard for Principals.Note: Projects will be based on a set of topics that will be introduced in \u2018EDUC90786 Leading Educational Research\u2019."
