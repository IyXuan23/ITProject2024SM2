    "overview": [
        "Modern statistics and data science deals with data having multiple dimensions. Multivariate methods are used to handle these types of data. Approaches to supervised and unsupervised learning with multivariate data are discussed. In particular, methods for classification, clustering, and dimension reduction are introduced, which are particularly suited to high-dimensional data. Both parametric and nonparametric approaches are discussed."
