    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed for second and third year JD students who are interested in academic legal scholarship. It will expose students to current areas of research and introduce them to the process of producing scholarly work at a professional level. Students will learn how to critically and constructively assess scholarly works-in-progress, and will develop their own views about particular debates, topics, and methods of inquiry.",
        "Students will be expected to demonstrate skills and knowledge acquired in a series of \u2018response papers\u2019 that comment on/critique the works in progress under examination. Response papers will form the basis of assessment for the subject.",
        "Students will meet with the subject coordinator seven times over the course of the semester. There are two kinds of meetings that students will be required to attend: those held concurrently with the regularly scheduled meeting of the Legal Theory Workshop (workshop weeks); and student-only meetings held during weeks when there is no Legal Theory Workshop meeting scheduled (seminar weeks).",
        "The Legal Theory Workshop is Melbourne Law School\u2019s works-in-progress discussion forum for faculty and research higher degree students, which meets regularly throughout the academic year. Each meeting features an unpublished article-length paper from a guest author, circulated and read in advance by workshop participants. Workshop guests regularly include distinguished legal scholars from across Australia and overseas. Topics vary depending on the guest\u2019s particular area of scholarly expertise and research interests and cover a wide range of issues in legal scholarship across all sub-disciplines. Past topics have included:",
        "International legal obligations and indigenous peoples;",
        "Moral disagreement and legal justification;",
        "Private law and social illusion; and",
        "Religion and legal reasoning.",
        "During workshop weeks, students will meet for one hour before the Legal Theory Workshop meeting to discuss student response papers and the workshop guest's paper. After that hour is over, students will attend the two hour workshop meeting.",
        "In addition, during two seminar weeks, students will meet for one hour with the subject coordinator to discuss topics related to legal scholarship and academia. This will include one introductory meeting, plus an additional meeting to discuss a topic selected based on students\u2019 interests."
