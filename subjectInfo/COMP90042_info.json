    "aims": [
        "Much of the world's knowledge is stored in the form of text, and accordingly, understanding and harnessing knowledge from text are key challenges. In this subject, students will learn computational methods for working with text, in the form of natural language understanding, and language generation. Students will develop an understanding of the main algorithms used in natural language processing, for use in a diverse range of applications including machine translation, text mining, sentiment analysis, and question answering. The programming language used is Python."
