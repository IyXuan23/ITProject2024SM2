        "This subject provides students with the opportunity to integrate knowledge gained in the theoretical subjects with clinical practice in the neonatal intensive care setting. The subject provides a comprehensive approach to care of the neonatal patient through understanding principles of illness/health management relating to the newborn, infant and family.",
        "The students develop skills of assessment and management principles which enable them to progress to a more advanced level of practice. Students are given the opportunity to plan and coordinate care for neonatal patients with a wide variety of problems. There is a continued emphasis on scientific principles and research evidence underpinning practice and further developing of skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, rational inquiry and self-directed learning to solve patient management problems in specialty practice. The practical component is in the form of a learning contract whereby students address learning objectives. Learning objectives focus on undertaking accurate assessment of the neonatal patient and relating the underlying physiological and pathophysiological processes to assessment data; applying theoretical knowledge to technical skill development; developing evidence-based evaluations to the practice of caring for patients in the neonatal intensive care unit and developing skills in sharing knowledge with peers.",
