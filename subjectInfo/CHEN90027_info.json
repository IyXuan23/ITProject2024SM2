    "indicative content": [
        "The subject will present details on the types of fossil fuels available (coal, oil, natural gas), the geology involved in their formation and the underlying chemistry for power generation. Aspects of petroleum reservoir engineering will be detailed, including exploration, well drilling and reservoir control. The subsequent petroleum product processing will be explained, including refinery and subsequent chemical processing, including the various usages of petroleum products. The combustion of fossil fuels for power generation will be described, with detailed analysis of carbon emissions and reduction strategies, including carbon capture and storage. This will also involve details on enhanced oil recovery. Future fuels that replace petroleum, including hydrogen and methanol, will also be presented in terms of their potential, chemical synthesis and usage. In addition, economics of power generation will be covered, in terms of cost of electricity and carbon accounting, along with health and safety, risk assessment and management and legal issues of petroleum engineering.",
