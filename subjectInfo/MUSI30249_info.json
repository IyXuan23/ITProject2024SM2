        "This subject examines music-making in the European art music tradition during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in its social, cultural and historical contexts. By examining musical works, historical documents, and modern scholarship, students explore both the development of new musical styles as well as the reimagination of older styles.",
        "In-class discussions, quizzes, and exercises support students as they examine how post-WWI institutions, discourses and technologies have reshaped the lives of musicians and listeners, with a particular focus on the overlapping political-economic contexts of capitalism, liberalism and globalisation.",
        "Students use primary and secondary sources to complete an original research essay on a topic related to music-making in post-Federation Australia, reflexively situating their own creative practice within the discipline."
