    "overview": [
        "Physiology is an integrative study of the control of normal body function. The specialised organ systems to be studied include the nervous, cardiovascular, muscular, respiratory, kidney and digestive systems. During this subject students will learn that physiology is an experimental science with many key concepts arising from qualitative and quantitative observation and analysis of living organisms. The lectures will incorporate active interaction between students and lecturers using live polling software to answer questions during lectures."
