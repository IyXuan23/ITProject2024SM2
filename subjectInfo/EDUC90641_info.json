    "overview": [
        "This subject offers an overview and exploration of contemporary theories about difference, equality, social justice, identity and youth. It maps the recent history and development of these ideas, and situates them in relation to youth studies. The politics and processes of social change are examined, including what claims to social change and social justice involve and some of the central challenges and dilemmas this represents for young people. Students will gain an understanding of major and influential debates involving the above key concepts, and critically explore their relevance to educational research, theory and practice. Examples will be drawn from national and international settings. There will be opportunities for students to develop in-depth study of select concepts and issues. Topics covered include: feminist and postcolonial theories of identity and difference; diverse approaches to understanding subjectivity; new forms of gender and class analysis; anti-racism; social justice and human rights; and the impact of theories of difference and identity on social and educational practices."
