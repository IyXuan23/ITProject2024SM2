        "Students enrolled in this subject will undertake a piece of research in Gender and Development approved by the course coordinator. The research will incorporate an analysis of relevant development theory and practice through the gendered lens. Under the close guidance of a dedicated supervisor, students are expected to engage critically and independently with relevant intellectual debates and provide original insights into a particular gender and development phenomenon or issue. In particular, they are required to demonstrate their in-depth understanding of key feminist critiques of development theories and gender analysis skills. On completion of the subject, students will submit a 15,000-word minor thesis on their chosen research topic."
