    "overview": [
        "In this subject students participate in an individual program of supervised research at an overseas institution in which the student contributes to the design of a research project, in consultation with a supervisor at that institution; conducts the research; and presents the findings of the project. The project may be self-contained or form a component of a larger research program. Each student will receive feedback on their progress through ongoing consultation with their supervisor.",
        "By conducting their research at an overseas institution students gain an understanding of scientific research in an international context. The research experience is organised through the Faculty of Science, including any processes required by the host institution. A University of Melbourne academic staff member who has allied research expertise co-supervises the project and coordinates the assessment requirements.",
        "Detailed assessment requirements, including due dates of individual assessment items, are determined through consultation between the international supervisor, University of Melbourne co-supervisor and the Science Research Project Coordinator(s) in the relevant University of Melbourne department.",
        "The subject will incur additional costs such as travel and accommodation. Students may be eligible for University funding. Where the host institution is located in the Indo-Pacific, Australian citizens for whom this subject is part of a full-time semester of study may consider applications through the New Colombo Plan scholarship funding."

        "Design a research project to meet particular research outcome(s) or to answer particular research question(s)",
        "Develop creative ways of solving unfamiliar problems by devising a methodological approach to address the research question being raised",
        "Collect and analyse data (qualitative and quantitative) including appropriate statistical analyses of the research results",
        "Communicate the research results in written form, requiring critical analysis, synthesis and organisation of knowledge, and the construction of a rational and lucid scientific argument",
        "Communicate the research results in another form \u2013 either through an oral presentation or poster presentation",
        "Manage the time allocated to completing specific tasks",
        "Depending on the project, students may also find they achieve other outcomes such as learning how to take account of ethical considerations in designing a project."
