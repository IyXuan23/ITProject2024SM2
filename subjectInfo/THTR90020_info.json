    "overview": [
        "In this practice-based subject the student writer undertakes a range of writing classes and exercises with the aim of developing techniques for the generation and structuring of original material for live performance within a collaborative context; in working to a brief in diverse professional circumstances; and in developing the skills necessary to negotiate a collaborative creative vision.",
        "Students engage in a range of collaborative writing exercises including working with performers on a small group devised project, team writing, improvisation, writing with/for communities, and collaborative adaptations of existing dramatic texts. The subject focuses on the relationship between form and content, and between performers and the audience, on tensions between order and disorder, questions of authorship, and what constitutes performance in the hyper-real digital age.",
        "New international and Australian forms of \u2018decentered\u2019 collaborative dramaturgy, in which a multiplicity of trends, narratives and directions run in parallel and/or intersect in various innovative ways, will also be explored. From time to time there will be master classes with visiting professional performance writers."
