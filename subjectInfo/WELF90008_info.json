    "overview": [
        "This subject is a co-requisite for the year-long clinical practice subject (PAED 90020), and provides a forum for discussion and reflection of issues arising in the clinical placements, to allow development of the skills learned on clinical placement. Knowledge attained in year 1 will be reviewed and built upon through group discussion. Critical reflective practice will be enhanced through supervision, and discussion and consideration of issues that are presented by students arising in their clinical practice. Students will be encouraged to develop self-awareness, the ability to critically evaluate practice and to enhance practice and genetic knowledge skills through the use of supervision and extensive reading. Together with Genetic Counselling Practice 1 this subject will develop the skills of ethical reflective genetic counselling practice. Students will develop an understanding of the career pathways available to genetic counsellors and will demonstrate competence in preparation of a curriculum vitae and development of interview skills for future employment as a graduate of the Masters."
