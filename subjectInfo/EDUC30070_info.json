        "This subject explores the relationship between, coach, athlete, coaching program and educational context, and encourages students to develop an open and reflective approach to their own coaching practice.  It offers a deeper insight into the theory and practice of sports coaching, highlighting the pedagogy underpinning good coaching practice, and demonstrating how analysis of ability informs selection.  It addresses key issues such as instructional methods and reflection, positioning the athlete as a learner.  It also explores how sports science and teaching pedagogies can be used to enhance athletic performance.",
        "Students will be expected to apply the theoretical knowledge learnt in this subject through the development, implementation and evaluation of coaching programs that they have designed for their specific sport or activity.  Participation in coaching sessions will enable students to hone these skills and put theory into practice."
