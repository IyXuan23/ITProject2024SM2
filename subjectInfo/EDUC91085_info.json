        "This subject will support Teacher Candidates to make decisions about responding to students\u2019 learning needs using evidence-informed approaches. Teacher Candidates will explore the science of learning and its relationship to effective, culturally informed teaching and learning strategies. To support students\u2019 participation, Teacher Candidates will identify and respond to behaviours of concern and the contexts in which they emerge. Teacher Candidates will understand the historical and contextual factors in which language and communication are embedded and develop strategies to support the language and communication needs of students. The Clinical Teaching Model will be used to assess, plan and develop interventions for students with disability and diverse learning needs. Teacher Candidates will examine the importance of parent/carer involvement in education and how to work effectively with colleagues, other professionals and the community.  This subject will also support Teacher Candidates\u2019 explorations of classroom communication and management practices and strategies that support students\u2019 wellbeing and safety to provide high-quality inclusive learning environments that meet school and/or system, curriculum and legislative requirements. It will equip Teacher Candidates with the fundamental skills necessary to begin to observe, design and implement teaching strategies to engage all students. This subject references the relevant Australian educational frameworks and curricula.",

A series of seminars will be held which explore candidate\u2019s developing professional knowledge, practice and engagement.In this subject Teacher Candidates will also complete the AssessmentforGraduate Teaching (AfGT)."
