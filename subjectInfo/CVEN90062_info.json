    "overview": [
        "In the past few years, the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has observed the evolution of simple 2D drafting programs into integrated Building Information Modelling (BIM) based on 3D spatial technologies. In this subject, students will learn how BIM is used to model, store and visualise architectural, structural, and facilities components of an infrastructure in 3D. Students will also learn how adding time and cost information to BIM allows AEC to foster collaboration in designing infrastructures, minimize the risk of construction errors and optimise the maintenance of them.",
        "The subject is of particular relevance to students wishing to establish a career in civil engineering, property management, surveying, spatial information and urban planning but is also relevant to a range of disciplines where 3D building information should be considered."
