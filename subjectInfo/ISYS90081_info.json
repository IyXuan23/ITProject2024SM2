        "Business Process Management (BPM) is a well-established discipline for improving organisational performance. By using a \u2018process lens\u2019, BPM enables organisations to systematically oversee how work is performed, in order to ensure consistent outcomes and take advantage of improvement opportunities.",
        "This subject provides an in-depth introduction to BPM by covering the typical phases of a BPM project, from process identification to process monitoring, addressing along the way the discovery, analysis, redesign and implementation of business processes. The subject supports course-level objectives of developing analytical skills to understand the complexity of real-world organisations. It contributes to the development of independent critical inquiry, analysis and reflection.",

    ],
    "indicative content": [
        "Topics include methods, techniques and tools for process identification and discovery, for process analysis and redesign, and for process implementation and monitoring. Students will learn how to identify business processes within an organisation, how to organise them in a business process architecture and prioritise the management of these processes. Students will also be exposed to a broad range of techniques to discover business processes in the form of process models (using the BPMN standard), to analyse process issues on the basis of these models, and to assess the qualitative and quantitative impact of these issues on organisation performance. Students will further learn how to evaluate and implement different process redesign options aimed at lifting the identified issues, and how to monitor the adherence of the redesigned processes to set performance targets. The subject also exposes students to recent developments in the area of process mining."
