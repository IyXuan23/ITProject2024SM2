        "This subject provides students with a background in research design, ethics, statistics and literature review before commencing a research project. In the 3rd year of the DDS, the continuation and completion of this project will take place under the companion subject 'Dental Research Project B\u2019. At the commencement of this subject, students will be divided into groups and a supervisor and research project will be allocated to each group. Each group will be maintained throughout second and third years. The School reserves the right to adjust the membership of a group when necessary. The research project can be undertaken in any of the following disciplines: Restorative Dentistry, Growth and Development, Oral Biology, Oral Medicine, Pathology and Surgery or Population and Oral Health Sciences or any related discipline after consultation with the Convener. In conjunction with the supervising staff member(s), each group will be required to develop the research project's aims and objectives, determine the details on facilities required and consult with the supervisor(s) at regular intervals."
