        "This subject aims to further develop students\u2019 knowledge of modern analytical tools and techniques, including GLM, shrinkage techniques (e.g., LASSO and ridge regression), tree-based methods (e.g., random forests and GBM) and neural networks. It also teaches students to connect data analytics work to the actuarial control cycle and real-world business environments. Effective communication of findings to a range of business decision making audiences is also stressed."
