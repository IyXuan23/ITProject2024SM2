        "This subject provides a rigorous introduction to numerical nonlinear optimization, as used across all of science and particularly in engineering design. There is an emphasis on both the theory and application of optimization techniques, with a focus on solving unconstrained and constrained nonlinear programmes. This subject is intended for graduate and research higher-degree students in engineering.INDICATIVE CONTENT",
