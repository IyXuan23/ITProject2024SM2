    "overview": [
        "This subject explores modern and contemporary literature in English. Beginning with Anglophone modernism, it introduces students to key works from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries across genres such as poetry, drama, the novel, the short story, and memoir. Where modern writers strive for new modes of representation in an era of rapid social change, contemporary writers contend with which genres and actions are still meaningful even as they push us to imagine different ways of being in the world. Students will learn to read these texts closely and to situate them in relation to their cultural, political, and historical contexts. The subject will also introduce students to influential developments in literary criticism and critical theory."
