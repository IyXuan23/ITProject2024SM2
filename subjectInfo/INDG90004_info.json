        "This subject allows Fellows in the Atlantic Fellows for Social Equity (AFSE) program to develop their knowledge, skills and attitudes in collaborative research and practice in a way that deepens their ability to work within Indigenous ethical and methodological frameworks. The subject will provide significant time for collaboration with and amongst Fellows and enable deeper knowledge of methods and strategies for collaborative work. Fellows will be afforded the opportunity to explore \u2018place\u2019 as a critical tool for collaborating with Indigenous people and places. Fellows will experience working together to understand the intersection of Indigenous knowledges and social change leadership. Participants will have the opportunity to reflect on and clarify their own collaborative processes, and ethical approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of projects designed to achieve Indigenous-led social change."
