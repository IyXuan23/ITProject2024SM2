    "overview": [
        "This lecture and laboratory-based subject aims to give students a solid foundation in basic physiological processes in animals, with a focus on the different ways in which animals are adapted to their environments. Particular emphasis will be placed on marine and desert animals, and the integrative mechanisms involved in the regulation of important organ systems. Topics include endocrine feedback, neural integration, water, food and salt balance, cardiorespiratory systems, thermoregulation, metabolism and reproduction."
