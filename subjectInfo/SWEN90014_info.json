        "This subject gives students in the Master of Engineering (Software) their first experience in analysing, designing, implementing, managing and delivering a small software engineering project. The aim of the subject is to give students an understanding of the major phases of software development, what each phase requires and how that phase fits into the overall engineering process. The subject also aims to give students an understanding of the importance of analysis, design, quality assurance activities and management activities within a software engineering process and to underpin the practical aspects of the management, analysis, design and validation subjects within the degree."

        "Students will work in teams to conceive, analyse, design, implement and test a non-trivial software system for an external client. A key part of the project is for students to develop and manage a repeatable process in order to deliver a quality software product Workshops will explore the application of theory to your project and include selected topics drawn from: requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and software project management relevant to the phase of the project that students are currently working on.",

            "LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS",
            "The philosophy behind the subject is that students learn software engineering by \u2018doing it\u2019. The software engineering project provides a realistic learning environment typically with an external client that wants to use the software.",
            "Each student team is assigned a supervisor who acts as a mentor and guide throughout the project. Teams meet with their supervisor regularly to monitor progress and to discuss issues that arise during the project. The interaction between the student team and the client often raises issues that provide the topics for workshops and supervisor meetings.",
            "The subject comprises one lecture and one two-hour workshop per week. Lectures are used to coordinate the teams, deliver software engineering theory and practice relevant to the stage of the project reached, and to share experiences between the teams. Workshops are used to discuss issues raised within the project, translate theory to practice relevant to the stage of the project reached and to share experiences.",
            "INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCES",
            "The subject is administered through the University\u2019s Learning Management System (LMS). Templates for the various artefacts, guidelines on engineering processes and links to software engineering tools are available through the LMS. A standard development environment is provided that includes programming languages, libraries and development tools is provided to the students and is available on most engineering computers.",
            "CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKS",
            "The software industry is expanding and along with it the demand for software engineers that are capable of the analytical and management skills beyond programming. The industry is also changing in the nature of the projects being undertaken with many software engineers now working in multidisciplinary project teams. The skills and experience gained in this subject are valued by employers and are often seen as a necessary grounding for a career in software and technology related industries.",
            "The subject uses external clients from outside of the Department and thus seeks to expose students to the types of environments in which software engineering projects take place. Guest lectures by are also given to highlight aspects of industrial practice and to expose students to the practical aspects of software engineering."
