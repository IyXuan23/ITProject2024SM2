    "overview": [
        "The world of work is undergoing significant transformation in response to a wide range of economic, social and technological changes. These changes have important consequences for how work is organised, how people are managed and how labour markets perform. This subject looks at how these developments are managed by organisations as well as the macro-level through public policy responses aimed at balancing competing policy objectives. This subject draws on both theory and evidence to explore new Human Resource Management and employment issues and policy responses emerging in many countries around the world, including: new actors and institutions; the transformation of professions and careers structures; investing in and managing human capital, voice and representation at work; workforce diversity; technological change, new business models and new forms of working; online labour markets; the quality of jobs and work-life; labour market inequality and insecurity; and the global competition for jobs."
