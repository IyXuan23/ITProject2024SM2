    "overview": [
        "In this subject, students continue to be exposed to the diversity of the Hispanic World through project work and speakers from the community, and to critically reflect on their own awareness and understanding of the cultural identities of the Hispanic World. Students also learn to converse in a variety of situations that progressively become less personal and more related to the world around them. Spanish 2 equips students with more sophisticated language and intercultural skills to engage with authentic materials such as songs, film, social media and short written texts designed to develop an appreciation of the wide range of identities that make up the Hispanic World. Students work on a project involving an interview with a member of the Hispanic community, which fosters both their intercultural skills and their reading, listening, writing and speaking skills. Writing strategies such as editing, summarizing and persuasive techniques prepare students to produce a number of texts including summaries, essays, biographies and blog entries using present and past tenses to describe personal experiences. Important cultural information about food, travel, migration, festivals, personal relationships and working life in the Hispanic World will support students in communicating appropriately. Students also develop their digital literacy as well as a number of skills relevant to a workplace environment, such as problem-solving, team work, clear communication, interviewing, information literacy and professionalism.",
        "",
        "Part of the assessment of this subject will contribute to the ePortfolio students develop in their Spanish and Latin American Studies subjects. This digital platform offers students the opportunity to showcase relevant workplace skills and digital and intercultural competencies in the target language, as well as individual interests and ideas."
