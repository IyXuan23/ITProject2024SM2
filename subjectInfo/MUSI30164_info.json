        "This subject aims to give integrity, intention and direction to Historical Performance at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music to enable students to build confidence, knowledge and expertise on their instruments and to expand their horizons with practical experience on period instruments, and in the use of historical performance styles.",
        "The ensemble is divided into tutti and instrumental groups. The performance pitch is A415Hz and repertoire is tailored to the composition of each group. Weekly classes culminate in an end-of-semester performance or recording.",
        "Through reviewing two performances or recent recordings of a live concert on period instruments, students will learn to evaluate historically informed performance practice in a contemporary context.",
        "The following Early Music instruments are available for hire from the Conservatorium collection: violin, viola, violoncello, viol (treble, tenor and bass), flute (traverso), oboe, bassoon, trumpet, trombone (sackbut consort), and natural horn.",
        "For this ensemble, skill on an early instrument is required.",
        "The minimum level of performance required for this ensemble would be equivalent to AMEB grade 7 or a high grade for VCE solo performance.",
        "Delivery",
        "This subject is co-taught with MUSI10042 Baroque Ensemble 2 and MUSI20070 Baroque Ensemble 2. Students cannot simultaneously enrol in co-taught subjects in the same study period."
