        "In this subject students will engage with creative and intellectual concepts that deal with an understanding of place (and places) and its relationship to individuals, communities and cultural formations. These places may be physical, social or psychological, and can include \"natural\". landscapes, urban/industrial environments, the genealogies of family or place and the connections between memory and physical space.",
        "This subject asks students to engage with writings by novelists and poets in addition to non-fictional texts to stimulate their own creative writing project that will be developed and workshopped in the seminars. Students will explore the relationship between the creative process and the development of written and performative texts. On completion of the subject students will have produced a folio of writing that can include prose-fiction, poetry, performance/script or non-fiction."
