        "The diversity of language within Japanese, be it phonetical, lexical, morphological, grammatical and strategical, exist according to the speaker\u2019s gender, age, hometown and type of communication one is engaged in. To ensure successful communication in Japanese, one must learn not only the \u2018standard\u2019 language introduced in textbooks so far, but also have knowledge of these variation which is observable in any interaction.",
        "This advanced level Japanese language subject aims to expand students\u2019 horizon on Japanese by introducing varieties of colloquial and dialectal expressions used in Japan, differentiated by their gender, age, region and purpose of communication. It will also give students opportunities to examine different registers in various conversation settings. Students will learn what is considered appropriate in various situations through analysis of naturally occurring communication between friends, family and business associates with different degree of formality through analysing them, then apply the findings in their speaking practice appropriately. Students who complete this subject should have acquired basic knowledge of the diverse range of Japanese language practice to engage in further learning."
