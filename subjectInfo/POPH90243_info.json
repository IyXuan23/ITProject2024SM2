    "overview": [
        "Within \u2018Epidemiology in Practice\u2019 students will work to address issues in health and public health by learning and applying epidemiological concepts. Students will learn systematic review and meta-analysis methodology through undertaking a small systematic review and meta-analysis, and then making policy recommendations. Students will also learn questionnaire development principles and apply these principles in developing and piloting their own questionnaire.",
        "In the second half of the subject, students will apply the concepts and methods involved in developing studies to assess the validity of questionnaires and tests to real-world examples in health/public health. The purpose and evaluation of screening programs will be discussed and applied to current controversies in screening. Lastly, students will learn about the role of natural experiments and how these study designs can be used to answer policy-relevant questions in public health."
