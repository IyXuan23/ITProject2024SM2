    "overview": [
        "The Monty Python team pondered many big questions, among them the rather tantalizing one: 'What did the Romans ever do for us?' This research seminar rises to the challenge as it involves discussions of revealing source material on the big issues in Roman social, cultural, political and religious history. Source readings will highlight the structure of Roman society and the plight of the common folk, Roman family life, Roman marriage, housing and city life, domestic and personal concerns, education, occupations, slaves, freedmen and freedwomen, government and politics, the Roman army, the provinces, women in Roman society, leisure and entertainment, and religion and philosophy. By gaining insight into the Roman way of life, students should be in a good position to assess the legacy of Roman civilization and come up with some plausible answers to the original question."
