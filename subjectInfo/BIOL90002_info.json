    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on common statistical approaches used to analyse biological data sets. Topics covered include research and experimental design, hypothesis testing, estimation, and statistical modelling for univariate and multivariate data. In interactive classes, students will consolidate concepts before working through examples in the context of different disciplines within the biosciences (including biomedicine, genetics, environmental science and ecology). The computer-based workshops will provide opportunities to translate theoretical knowledge into practice with emphasis on statistical interpretation, reasoning, and basic coding skills. By the end of the subject, students will have the statistical skills required to design, analyse, and interpret their own biological research."
