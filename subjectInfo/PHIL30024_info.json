    "overview": [
        "We read all the time: graffiti, text messages, articles inThe New York Times, fiction likeHarry Potteror Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets, scientific reports, or even philosophy articles. But what exactly is involved in understanding these texts?",
        "\u201cThe goal of interpretation is to reconstruct the author\u2019s intentions.\u201d \u201cThe reader plays an essential role in determining the meaning of a text.\u201d \u201cThe author, literature, the human subject are all dead.\u201d \u201cTexts should be deconstructed, not interpreted.\u201d \u201cBinaries like male/female also need to be deconstructed.\u201d \u201cEverything is a text.\u201d",
        "In this subject we\u2019ll explore the theories of meaning and interpretation which ground these influential and conflicting slogans. Our starting point will be Schleiermacher\u2019s suggestion that interpretation is a form of \u201cmental tourism\u201d aimed at the simulation of the author\u2019s original mental states. All the approaches we\u2019ll then consider will be increasingly radical departures from this simple idea. We\u2019ll first look at German Hermeneutics (Heidegger, Gadamer, Habermas) and its concepts of the hermeneutical circle and a fusion of horizons. We\u2019ll examine the French postmodernist tradition (Saussure, Barthes, Derrida, Butler) and the ideas of structuralism, post-structuralism and deconstruction. Finally, we\u2019ll take a look at seminal contributions to the understanding of interpretation in the Anglo-American analytic tradition. We\u2019ll consider whether radical interpretation \u2013 the interpretation of the language of a totally foreign culture \u2013 is possible, and if so by which methods (Quine, Davidson). We\u2019ll also examine whether there is a robust distinction between fiction and non-fiction (Walton). We\u2019ll ask whether fiction helps explain the mechanisms behind propaganda, whether photography is fictional (or whether it affords transparent access to the world), and whether imaginative engagement in fictional games, rather than beauty, is what\u2019s central to art."
