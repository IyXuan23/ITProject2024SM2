    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces Teacher Candidates to theory, research and practice which informs teaching language and literacy in the early years of schooling. Emphasis is on theoretical perspectives of literacy acquisition which highlight the reciprocal relationship between oral language, reading and writing, and an understanding of literacy as a social practice. Essential aspects of early reading and writing are prioritised, especially phonological development including phonemic awareness, reading comprehension, phonics, oral language, vocabulary, reading fluency, language and grammar.",
        "Teacher Candidates will develop specialised subject content knowledge for teaching and monitoring the language and literacy development of diverse early years learners, and of how this is organised in the Australian/Victorian English Curricula. Teacher Candidates will develop knowledge of effective teaching strategies and assessment tools and use the Clinical Teaching Model to identify students\u2019 interests, abilities and needs to inform what to teach next."
