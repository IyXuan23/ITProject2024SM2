    "overview": [
        "The concepts of sustainability are increasingly changing and driving the legal and regulatory context of our large, complex and smart cities. The global sustainable development goals have also led urban regulators to embrace more participatory and innovative forms of governance for our society and economy.",
        "This subject explores how sustainability concepts and framework apply in the regulation and governance of planning and construction towards smart, resilient and sustainable cities. In particular, it will focus on the role of municipal and state laws in achieving liveable communities. This topic offers a further but alternate perspective of shifting regulatory dynamics that pitch towards sustainability objectives, whether on built environment projects or across broad-scaled applications.",
        "The subject will explore the interesting tension between planning and building law and the respective contribution of each in driving sustainable outcomes. Climate change and green building developments are profiled in view of the changing political, legal and academic agendas.  New ideas on Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD) for urban settings are explored. A focus on ESD Local Planning Policies includes assessing whether planning regulation in Victoria incorporates best practice in environmental assessment. Within the urban environment, the subject further considers sustainability in the architecture, engineering and construction sectors, project procurement and across the built form lifecycle. This includes studying how sustainability objectives continue to challenge the legal, regulatory and policy frameworks and foster the interplay of emerging tools and digital developments.",
        "This subject has been designed for those interested in the intersection between planning and construction law and environmental law. The subject includes guest lectures, visiting some of Melbourne\u2019s iconic green buildings and infrastructure projects, and assessing urban planning initiatives for their contribution to the development of Melbourne as a sustainable city."
