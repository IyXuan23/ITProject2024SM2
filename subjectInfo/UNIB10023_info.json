        "Melbourne is often described as one of the \u2018world\u2019s most liveable cities\u2019. What makes Melbourne such a vibrant city and how did it get there? Did you know that the siting of the Melbourne CBD is actually related to ancient volcanic eruptions? The geology and natural environment around Melbourne provided the Indigenous clans of the eastern Kulin nation access to fresh water and proximity to the coastal and wetland resources that were central to their annual cycle of movements around their ancestral homeland for at least 30,000 years. These resources also made the area an ideal \u201cSite for a Village\u201d by European settlers who \u2018founded\u2019 the city in 1835. Since that time, Melbourne has undergone profound changes in its population, prosperity, cultural diversity, infrastructure and natural resources. Establishment of the city had a devastating impact on the Indigenous inhabitants and also became almost unliveable during periods of its history. What is happening now, or is being planned, to recognise this history and ensure the sustainability of our city into the future?",
        "This subject will take you on a journey across the city of Melbourne in space and time, exploring the natural, cultural and constructed development of this thriving city. A range of disciplinary perspectives will provide you with an awareness of how this city, and our University within it, have evolved to the present day, and what plans there are to sustain them both into the future"
