It will include architecture, designed landscapes and design traditions from early civilisations to colonial sites in Oceania and the Pacific, the Middle East, Europe, South Asia, East Asia and South America. It will survey and analyse values reflected in vernacular buildings, urban landscapes, and institutions of power and belief, and address innovations in spatial organisation, construction technology and design composition, and the importance of theory and ideas in representations of architecture, landscape and urbanism."
