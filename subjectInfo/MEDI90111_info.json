    "overview": [
        "This subject provides an understanding of the principles of toxicology as related to exposures commonly associated with terror and mass casualty events. The student will explore how poisons interact with biological systems to produce clinical toxicity (pharmacodynamics) and how the human body reacts to poisons to promote detoxification or elimination (pharmacokinetics).  The interaction of poisons on receptor families with subsequent production of recognisable patterns of clinical toxicity (toxidromes) and their importance in aiding diagnosis will be discussed. A discussion of general management of the poisoned patients will emphasise approaches to decontamination, enhanced elimination, utilisation of antidotes and supportive care particularly relating to common terror and mass casualty exposures.",
