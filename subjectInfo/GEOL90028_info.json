    "overview": [
        "The course covers the basic principles of Ar-Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Pb (conventional Pb-Pb, U-Pb, SHRIMP, LA-ICPMS, CHIME), Lu-Hf and Re-Os, as well as fission track and (U-Th)/He thermochronology. The application of these geochronology/thermochronology and isotopic tracing methods to a variety of geological problems will be presented. Afternoon sessions will be devoted to pracs (calculating ages, meaning of errors, plotting data e.g. isochrons, U-Pb plots, histograms using the computer package ISOPLOT and modelling thermal histories)."
