        "AIMSEnvironmental problems are highly complex and challenging to analyse and are often addressed through modelling. Being skilled at environmental modelling is a core professional requirement for an Environmental Engineer. This subject focuses on environmental modelling methodology including the steps of model conceptualisation, model construction, model evaluation and model application using a range of energy, water and waste models. The subject complements ENEN90032 Environmental Analysis Tools and ENEN90028 Monitoring Environmental Impacts which provide other core environmental engineering skills. It provides modelling skills for a wide range of discipline based subjects such as ENEN90006 Solid Wastes, ENEN90034 Environmental Applied Hydrology and ENEN90027 Energy for Sustainable Development. The subject is of particular relevance to all Environmental Engineers but is also of relevance to a range of engineering and environmental analysis disciplines that require advanced modelling skills.",
        "INDICATIVE CONTENTThe relationship between theoretical and empirical understanding and their use in model conceptualisation and construction will be explored. This subject introduces a range of environmental modelling techniques applicable to different environmental problems. In this subject students will conceptualise and construct, evaluate and utilise their own model to undertake a technical evaluation of a specified range of potential solutions to an environmental problem. Students will also develop professional judgement skills to critically evaluate models and model results.Specific topic areas:",

In addition each student undertakes and presents a literature review on an environmental modelling topic of their choice. The modelling assignments allow for choice between water, energy and waste focussed problems.INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCESThe subject textbook is Beven, K. 2009Environmental Modelling: An Uncertain Future?Routledge.In addition a range of journal papers, many of which are review papers, are provided.Students are also expected to search the journal and other literature available through the library.MatLab self-paced learning is available athttp://aaee-scholar.pbworks.com/Learn-MATLABCAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKSPresenter(s) from industry present a modelling case study. Students who are already working in industry can base their literature review topic on an aspect of modelling relevant to their workplace."
