    "overview": [
        "There has been an explosion in the collection, and availability, of spatial information in the modern era.  Locational data from smart phones, drones, and new generations of satellites, are examples of the growing opportunities that spatial data present for geography.  Spatial analysis skills are now in high demand among many employers.",
        "Understanding how to think about spatial data, and how to analyse those data, provides transformational skills. This subject equips students to map connections between nature and people, spatialise the impacts of climate change on humans and their environment, and use spatial data to inform decisions. Students will also gain an understanding of technical, ethical and analytical dimensions of spatial data.  This subject teaches broad spatial skills and is equally useful for students of human, environmental, or physical geography.",
        "While the subject develops competency with relevant software, the emphasis is on understanding key concepts regarding spatial data and how to formulate and answer spatial questions.  The subject is structured around weekly, computer-based practicals which combine spatial skills with critical thinking.  Half of the assessment comes from assignments in which students individually solve spatial data problems in geography."
