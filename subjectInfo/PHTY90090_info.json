        "The focus in Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy 1 is to assist students to achieve a dynamic combination of attributes, abilities and attitudes in the area of musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice. The subject aims to introduce students to specific areas of knowledge, skills and theories of musculoskeletal practice. It also aims to facilitate their ability to move from a specific and detailed knowledge of common musculoskeletal conditions. It will use methods of assessment, diagnosis and management to facilitate a deeper and more critical comprehension and analysis of this area of physiotherapy practice. This will be applied to individuals and populations and positioned in relation to other areas of physiotherapy practice. Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy 1 builds on students\u2019 foundational knowledge of physiotherapy theory and practice and prepares students to move to their clinical placements in the following semester of the program. This subject includes 12 hours of clinical (generic) placement."
