        "The aim of this subject is to provide the student with the knowledge and skills to enable them to develop clinical leadership in their area of specialty. The subject considers contemporary issues related to professional practice and clinical leadership in advanced practice nursing roles. The core content of this subject will assist the student to understand the political, economic, professional, ethical, social and clinical influences on clinical leadership and advanced practice nursing models. Students will critique different models of clinical leadership, service delivery, governance structures, and methods for evaluating and sustaining measurable outcomes in practice. The subject will also assist students to identify their own learning and development needs with respect to clinical leadership and, where necessary, negotiate access to a range of resources to enable them to meet their learning objectives.",
