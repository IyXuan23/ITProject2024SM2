        "This is a capstone internship experience subject, which enables students to integrate the knowledge acquired through their coursework and apply this knowledge within the veterinary industry. Students will undertake a six week placement within a relevant organisation and develop the professional skills required to function within such an organisation. The subject aims to provide students with an extended work based experience within a veterinary industry of their choice, including government, private industry or a non-government organisation (NGO). Students will have the opportunity to develop their experience of working with and leading diverse teams within the workplace setting. Additionally, students will gain an understanding of the role of veterinarians within this industry, and of graduate employer expectations."
