    "overview": [
        "In this subject students will use computational techniques to explore atmospheric processes and phenomena, including storms, atmospheric circulation, and climate feedbacks. The subject will develop skills in modelling the atmosphere, using modern computational and numerical frameworks and mathematical and physical reasoning. Mathematical techniques including differential equations and finite differencing will be used along with application of fundamental physical principles to real world problems in meteorology and climate science. Students will also analyse and map real-world atmospheric datasets, including satellite data and numerical models of the atmosphere."
