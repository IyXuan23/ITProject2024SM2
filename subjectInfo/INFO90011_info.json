        "Nearly 40% of healthcare costs can be attributed to wastage and harm. At the same time, digital health and informatics is generating rich and valuable data that can be used to generate insights and improve the quality of care, enhance patient-centred care, as well as dramatically increase value-based care. While, on average, it takes 17 years for research to translate and have impact in the clinical setting, the Learning Health System framework allows for immediate real-time interrogation of data and implementation of knowledge gained in rapid quality improvement cycles, to ultimately improve patient outcomes.",
        "This subject will enable students to simulate and reflect on a Learning Healthcare System approach to a health service digital transformation project; to use digital patient data to gain new knowledge about a problem; to use this knowledge to inform a digital innovation in practice; and to use the ensuing practice-based evidence to guide digital health management decisions. These concepts will be taught through the lens of a real-world digital health intervention case study and the toolkit approach provides a framework to apply to the learners\u2019 workplace endeavours."
