        "In this subject students consolidate the basic elements covered in Latin 1, and are introduced to more complex grammar and syntax. Increasingly difficult literary and dramatic texts are read. Background information on Roman culture is woven into the subject matter throughout the semester. By the end of the subject, students should have a sufficient grasp of the language to read texts of moderate difficulty with vocabulary assistance. Students who complete this subject may progress to Latin 3."
