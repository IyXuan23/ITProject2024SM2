        "The aim of this subject is to enable students to undertake advanced study in the area of stress physiology in domestic and companion animals. The major focus will be on the interaction between physiological state and the environment and the consequences for animal performance and production. Specific emphasis will be on developing skills in monitoring physiological stress and being able to manage the environment for improved animal performance and production.",
        "The content will cover contemporary issues related to physiological and metabolic adaptations in response to stress during growth, pregnancy and lactation and will include physical, psychological and nutritional factors; energy and water balance and thermoregulation; and management of the environment including aspects of housing."
