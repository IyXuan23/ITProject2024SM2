        "GeoDesign is an emerging field in which the analytical rigor and methodological strategies of geospatial sciences are being fused with the forward thinking, creativity, and graphic capabilities of landscape architecture, urban planning and design. This subject explores geodesign models and applications. Specifically, the subject will introduce geodesign methods and their practical consequences in the reconfiguration of vision, knowledge, professional practice and embodied experience in geodesign.",
