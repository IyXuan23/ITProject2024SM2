    "overview": [
        "The implication of climate change on the liveability of cities is becoming increasingly apparent. This seminar explores the issue of heat and thermal comfort in the design of the public domain.",
        "This intensive is open to design students (architecture, landscape architecture and urban design) and planners. We will explore the potentials of contemporary digital tools (simulation, Rhino and grasshopper) and data (including sensors and real-time) combined with current theoretical writings crossing climate change science, cultural studies and digital design to develop innovative design and planning responses.Students will research and explore a range of techniques including data capture, the use of simulation software and engage critical analysis of design precedents to produce a design proposition for a site in Melbourne which responds directly to the issues of a warming climate.",
