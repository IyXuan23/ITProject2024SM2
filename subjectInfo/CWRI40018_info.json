    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on writers collaborating with musicians, scientists, visual and sound artists, architects, designers, theatre-makers, activists, historians, psychologists, photographers, film-makers. Collaborations can give birth to genuinely new ways of thinking and seeing the world. When all collaborating parties are fully extended it may spark unexpected, out-of-the-box work. We are interested in creative partnerships that push people beyond their respective comfort zones and that thrive on plurality \u2013 not only of art forms and disciplines but of fundamental approaches to research and meaning-making.",
        "We will also think deeply about the ethos and ethics of collaboration, about how successful collaborations are structured and kept vital and nourishing. We won\u2019t forget to consider creativity. What happens when we are not alone at various stages of the creative process?",
        "Students will be encouraged to imagine and develop collaborations \u2013 to bring their talents and skills into fertile and fabulous creative relationships with people outside the field of writing. Students will also collaborate with each other in the development of creative work(s)."
