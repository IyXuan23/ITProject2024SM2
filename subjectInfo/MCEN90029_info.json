        "This course will expand on the basic principles established previously in Solid Mechanics.",
        "Methods of three-dimensional stress and strain analysis will be extended to allow the student to obtain solutions using analytical and/or numerical methods. These will include the analyses of principal stresses and strains, three dimensional Mohr\u2019s circles, strain gauge experimentation and failure criteria. In addition, this unit will focus on plastic deformation of solids, including the analysis of residual stresses and the collapse load of structures. The responses of materials to fatigue and fracture, as well as their creep and viscoelastic behaviour, will also be explored. Finally, this unit will provide a number of examples of experimental applications of solid mechanics analysis based on modern research techniques.",
        "The goal of Advanced Solid Mechanics is to consolidate the solid mechanics principles presented in the student\u2019s Engineering degree, and the equip students with skills required to solve a range of engineering problems they have not seen before. In addition, this subject seeks to teach a number of modern research methods, techniques and skills by drawing on biomechanical research in the field of solid mechanics, and the major challenges in the field.",

            "The end of semester examination will gauge students\u2019 ability to synthesise stress/strain correlations and mathematically model a common engineering design problem, for example, determining the correct geometry of a loaded body to avoid crack propagation (ILO 1 and 2). The exam will assess student\u2019s ability to describe a contemporary issue in biomechanics research (ILO 8). The examination will also evaluate the student\u2019s capacity to model material behaviour, for example, stresses and strains of materials under loading (ILO 3).",
            "The two assignments focus on problem solving in the context of a specific engineering principle presented in the lectures. Students will be expected to analyse an engineering structure using mathematical modelling (ILO 4), and to formulate analytical solutions to loading a loading problem (ILO 5). In so doing, they will expand their capacity to think laterally and gain a degree of independence in the overall learning experience (ILO 6). The small-group problem solving activity (set in laboratory classes) aims to encourage peer-to-peer communication, expression of ideas, team-building, and development of oral skills (ILO 7). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the group learning experience, the group activity will be assessed based on an inter-group peer-review evaluation and a short self-reflection piece. Feedback for the solution to the problem solving activity will be provided formatively by the lecturer. It is intended that this activity and the feedback prepare students for the two assignments tasks.",
