        "This subject is a special program of study on a particular area of interest within the linguistics and applied linguistics undergraduate program. It is designed to either complement an honours thesis topic, extend knowledge within a subject already studied, or research a topic not normally treated within the course. It is conducted by a program of intensive reading, designed by the student in consultation with a supervisor.",
        "The subject should enhance the student's knowledge of the subject area and should encourage initiative in self-directed research, develop the student's powers of independent inquiry, strengthen the student's capacities in theoretical analysis and argumentation, and develop the student's written communication skills."
