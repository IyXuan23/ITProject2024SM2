            "For the purposes of considering applications for Reasonable Adjustments under the Disability Standards for Education (Cwth 2005) and Students Experiencing Academic Disadvantage Policy, this subject requires all students to actively and safely participate in practical exercises conducted in pilot-scale food processing facilities as well as visits to commercial food processing facilities. Such activities may involve lifting, climbing multiple stairs and movement around equipment and compliance with the various organisations\u2019 OH&S requirements. Students who feel disability may impact upon their participation are encouraged to discuss this with the subject coordinator and the Disability Liaison Unit."
