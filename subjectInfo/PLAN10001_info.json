        "Metropolitan areas have changed substantially through history. This subject examines the ideas, values and forces that influenced the physical growth and development of urban areas in the developed world. Using examples in Melbourne where possible and focusing on specific features and concepts of space and community, the subject considers social, economic, political and environmental processes of urban change. It provides opportunities for students to speculate on the future of our cities in the twenty-first century and to consider the role of the planner, the citizen, governing bodies, and other forces, on the shape and changing role of the city.",
        "This subject will provide a lens on the University\u2019s Joining Melbourne Modules. These will be completed in parallel to the subject - unless already successfully completed. It will also support the Discovery goals for commencing students by introducing emerging concepts and research in thediscipline area; ways to connect with the larger University community including peers, teachers and student groups; and awareness of academic expectations, and of wellbeing support offered at the University of Melbourne."
