        "Students are to participate in the day-to-day operation of a laboratory working on experiments related to human decision-making, actively engaging in its tasks and projects, in order to acquire on-the-job experience with the practical aspects of designing, managing and analysing experiments, become accustomed with team work, and to help create science. To the extent it is practically possible given other coursework, the student is allowed to complete the laboratory assignment overseas in a collaborating laboratory."
