        "Comprehend the extractions, the surgical removal of teeth, surgical management of third molars, management of medically compromised patients, the surgical management of unerupted teeth, haemorrhage in a dental setting, as well as medical emergencies.",
        "Understand the basis of Special Needs Dentistry including gerodontics and related medical issues with aging, disease and health, developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, management of endocrine diseases, transplant medicine and dentistry as well as palliative dental care and be able to understand the complexities of managing patients with a range of these issues. They should be able to clearly understand the link between general health and oral health. Students should be comfortable when confronted by special needs patients in both clinical as well as in aged care and Institutionalised settings and have a sound understanding of consent and ethical issues as they pertain to this patient population and know the procedures involved when patients are unable to consent for themselves.",
        "Understand the competencies required to prescribe medicines. Health professionals who prescribe need to be equipped with competencies which enable them to make prescribing decisions which maximise the benefits and minimise the risks of using medicines to maintain the health of individuals and the community."
