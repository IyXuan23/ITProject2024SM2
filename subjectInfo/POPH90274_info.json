        "This is a core subject of the Master of Public Health degree. In this unit students will be introduced to the concepts, frameworks and methods used in prioritising and planning in public health. This unit will introduce students to the conceptual approaches and key methods used to conduct a health needs assessment and prioritise the identified needs for subsequent strategic planning. The unit will also explore the strategies and interventions that are commonly used to address health needs in populations and the criteria that can be used to select an appropriate intervention. Finally, the subject will consider essential concepts in the design and evaluation of health programs.Within this subject, students will have the opportunity to apply the skills learnt to public health scenarios drawn from Australian and international case-studies. The material in this subject is highly relevant in day to day public health practice."
