    "overview": [
        "Our knowledge of health comes from many different experiences, information sources and through different mediums. Our culture informs how we understand health and our expectations of health and health care. Western scientific knowledge also contributes to how we understand health. Furthermore, our experiences of health, illness, caring and wellbeing also contribute to our understandings of health.This unit explores various ideas about health and the integration, overlap and disjuncture of Aboriginal knowledges and Western knowledges of health.",
        "This unit explores how the field of health is influenced by different, sometimes competing ideas about what constitutes knowledge and what effects this has for the health and wellbeing of populations. Focusing particularly on the perspectives of Aboriginal Australians, it examines the nature, intersection and implications of various forms of health knowledges."
