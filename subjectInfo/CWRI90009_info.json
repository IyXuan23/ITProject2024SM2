        "This subject will explore writing children's, middle grade and young adult fiction. Students will critically engage with texts from these relatively new literary genres, examine issues of ethics, diversity, representation, identity, voice, and creatively navigate the spaces between childhood and adulthood. Exploring the historical development, trends, characteristics and common misconceptions of writing for young people, this subject will place children's, middle grade and young adult literature in the broader context of literary criticism and cultural studies."
