    "overview": [
        "For at least 400 years, patent law has been the primary regulatory mechanism for optimising innovation. With more than two million patent applications filed annually around the world, the patent system is both highly complex and of great economic importance. This subject provides the foundational knowledge necessary for a professional understanding of patent law and the patent system. It does so through a combination of instructional sessions and hands-on workshop sessions. The instructional sessions provide students with an understanding of the fundamental principles of patent law, with a particular focus on the requirements for the grant of a valid patent and infringement of a patent. In the workshop sessions, students apply these principles to actual patent claims, prior art and infringing embodiments. Consideration is also given to the protection of trade secrets through the action in equity to restrain a breach of confidence. While the focus of the teaching will be on Australian law, the differences between this and New Zealand law will be identified and explored throughout the subject. Comparative reference will also be made to the law of the United States and countries that are members of the European Patent Convention. Successful completion of this subject satisfies the knowledge requirements specified by the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board (TTIPAB) for \u2018Topic Group E\u2019.",
