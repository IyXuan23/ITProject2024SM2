        "This subject introduces the quantification of building works. It covers the principles and practice of measurement in simple residential construction including the application and use of the Australian Standard Method of Measurement (ASMM) of Building works in practice. It covers the following aspects: writing description/specifications for measured building items; purpose and preparation of Bill of Quantities (BoQ); Processes of preparing BoQ including: taking-off, working-up, abstracting and billing; types of bill formats and their uses; basic principles of measurement and description of the following: groundworks (ordinary strip foundation on flat sites \u2013 linear) and superstructure (walls \u2013 masonry, and partitions including cladding; floors in concrete, reinforcement and formwork, simple timber pitched roof, Roofing, and finishes); Concept of BoQ estimating, pricing of items and introduction to building-up of rates for work items; Introduction to computerised measurement; Tender process."
