    "overview": [
        "The explosion of research in the digital humanities and social sciences has created exciting opportunities for scholars but also poses important new questions. PhD students now need to know not only how to use digital resources in their work, but how to critique and evaluate those resources. This subject will examine what constitutes a digital archive; will provide discussion of the theory of archives; will include a variety of perspectives (academic, library, industry) on the uses of e-resources; and will offer a case studies approach to understanding the field."
