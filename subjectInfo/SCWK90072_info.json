        "This subject aims to introduce students to theories and frameworks surrounding professional social work identity. It will enable students to begin a process of self-exploration and assist them to translate this knowledge of self into professional social work contexts.  It will introduce students to the social work Professional Identity Framework and the use of e-portfolios as a way to collect and curate evidence of their emerging professional self in preparation for placement and the workforce. This subject will provide the scaffolding for students to develop their Professional Identity Framework while completing the course work and field placements of the Masters of Social Work. This subject is a prerequisite for Professional Identity 2 in which students will present their Professional Identity Framework and e-portfolio as an expression of professional social work identity, in preparation for graduate practice."
