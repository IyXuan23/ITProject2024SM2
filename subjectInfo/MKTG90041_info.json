        "This subject focuses on how to improve customer experiences (CX) through effective design and organisational change management. Students will learn how to design highly contextual and personalised experiences for customers through the use of Human Centred Design (HCD) principles, tools and techniques. Some of the HCD stages and tools include: the double diamond framework; discovery research; empathy mapping; customer personas; jobs-to-be-done; journey mapping; service blueprinting; ideation; desirability, viability and feasibility (DVF) framework; prototyping; concept testing, and reflection.",
        "Customer experience design examines the whole lifespan of a customer\u2019s experience with a brand through multiple physical and digital touch points, rather than focusing just on a single website or a mobile application development. Human Centred Design training is becoming a strong differentiator as the new business models demand an increased focus on customer service and creative problem solving."
