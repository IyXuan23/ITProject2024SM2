    "overview": [
        "The subject introduces students to the conceptual engineering design process, with an associated emphasis on realising autonomous mechanical systems. This includes clarifying the problem, ideation, concept evaluation, embodiment and prototyping. The design process incorporates concept evaluation against associated environmental, socio-economic and human factors, and safety.",
        "In addition, to support the design of autonomous mechanical systems, the subject will cover how machines work including basics on relevant mechanical and electro-mechanical machine elements."
