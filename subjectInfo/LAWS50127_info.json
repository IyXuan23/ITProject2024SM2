    "overview": [
        "Philosophical Foundations of Law is an interdisciplinary subject, run by Law School academics and prominent members of the judiciary. The aim of this subject is twofold \u2013 first, to develop in students a high-level understanding of how legal rules embody, and reflect, important philosophical notions which are themselves examinable; and, second, to develop in students a sophisticated approach to thinking about legal questions which employs philosophical rigour.",
        "The subject will be structured around a series of seminars run by guests who are experts in the area on which they are speaking. Guests will include academics, legal practitioners, and members of the judiciary. Some seminars will involve two presenters, one an academic and the other a judge/practitioner. These combinations are designed to demonstrate the close relationship, and conceptual overlap, between the disciplines of law and philosophy. Subject coordinators will ensure thematic continuity throughout the subject by drawing out common threads which emerge from individual presentations and class discussions.",
        "Particular topics to be covered will vary from year to year, but may include the following:",
        "the ethics of humanitarian action: the laws of war and aid;",
