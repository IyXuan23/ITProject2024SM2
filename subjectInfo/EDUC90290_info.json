    "overview": [
        "This subject examines theory and interventions for developing learning environments using positive behaviour support. Critical theoretical perspectives that underpin working effectively with behaviours of concern will be explored. The subject will assist students to understand how to use multi-tiered systems of support to promote positive behaviours, including School-wide Positive Behaviour Support. There will be a focus on understanding the communicative function of behaviour and the functional relationship between environment and behaviour. The impact of behaviour on school engagement will be investigated and explore how systems may limit access to education for students who may be exhibiting behaviours of concern. The importance of using function-based interventions for all learners including those who require more targeted or individualised responses will be examined. Students will demonstrate the use of function-based thinking and functional behaviour assessment to support learners."
