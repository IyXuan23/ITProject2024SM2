        "This subject is designed for students who have successfully completed Japanese 1 and 2, or Year 12 Japanese curriculum and can recognise around 150 kanji characters. In this subject, students will be introduced to around 100 new kanji characters. Students will develop skills to collect and use relevant information from published resources associated with history, travel and transport. Students will develop literacy through writing short informative area guides for a general audience. They will develop communication skills required to deal with giving and receiving gifts and favours, along with understanding of Japanese social norms such as reciprocity. Students will have opportunities to collaborate and interact with peers from different backgrounds. In addition, students will develop intercultural understanding through identification of common Japanese rituals and routines in giving gifts, suggestions and orders, then draw comparison between their own cultural practices."
