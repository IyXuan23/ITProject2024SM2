    "overview": [
        "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has heralded a new era of industrial and technological revolution, fundamentally altering the socio-economic and legal landscapes across the globe, with profound implications in Asia.",
        "AI\u2019s rapid and deep penetration into various sectors, including education, finance, manufacturing, transportation, social welfare, law enforcement, and healthcare, underscores its transformative potential. However, this transformation is accompanied by controversies and concerns, particularly around privacy, autonomy, equality and fairness, ethical dilemma, labour rights, and due process protections. The use of AI in government functions, its potential to exacerbate existing inequalities and discrimination, and the opaque nature of AI systems pose critical questions about accountability, justice, and human rights in the age of data-driven economy.",
        "This subject is designed to navigate the multifaceted legal, ethical, and policy challenges arising from the pervasive integration of AI technologies in society, with a focus on contextualising how Asian jurisdictions\u2014particularly China, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore\u2014perceive and respond to the challenges posed by AI, and whether and how they interact through regulatory competition, learning, and cross-referencing.  Focusing on the diverse legal systems and practices of selected East Asian countries, this subject explores the critical legal and policy challenges of AI and how governments are experimenting to shape the optimal institutional design for AI governance. Students will engage with issues such as data protection and privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, autonomous vehicles, the opacity of AI systems (\u201cblack box\u201d problem), and the use of AI in criminal justice systems and its due process considerations.",
