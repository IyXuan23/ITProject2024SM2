    "overview": [
        "This subject covers general dental practice including treatment planning and clinical practice of integrated dental care encompassing complex periodontal treatment, endodontics, fixed and removable prosthodontics, paediatric dentistry and management of patients having extensive and/or complex treatment needs due to medical conditions, a severely compromised dental status and/or high caries risk. Students will engage in clinical practice at the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne providing holistic, patient-centred oral health care, covering all aspects of oral health learnt to this point in the course. They will also have treatment planning sessions in groups, facilitated by a clinical supervisor. This subject should also be viewed as working in combination with other third year subjects as a means to provide total patient care."
