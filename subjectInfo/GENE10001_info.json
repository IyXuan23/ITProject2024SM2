    "overview": [
        "Whether it be the next potential breakthrough for a cancer cure or the creation of designer babies, genetics always seems to be part of the conversation within the media landscape. Thanks to advances in genetics techniques, we can now modify organisms at the DNA level, identify and treat a huge array of diseases and even help solve crimes. But just how accurate is the way genetics stories are portrayed in the media? And why are they portrayed the way they are?",
        "This subject will provide you with resources and activities, developed by geneticists and media experts, to help you develop a solid understanding of genetics concepts, how they relate to multiple aspects of our lives and how they are portrayed by the mainstream and social media.",
        "Completion of this subject will enable you to critically evaluate media articles relating to genetics, to identify the accuracy with which genetics is reported and be more alert to how and why the media portrays genetics topics as it does. Whether or not you have previously studied, or plan to continue studying, genetics, this subject will enable you to contribute informed opinions to many diverse conversations and debates around current and emerging genetics topics that influence our everyday lives."
