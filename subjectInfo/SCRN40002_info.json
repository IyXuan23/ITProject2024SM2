        "This subject will examine the history, uses and value of contemporary film and screen theory from the post-1968 period to the present. Students will learn to critically evaluate a diverse range of screen theories and methodologies, investigating their application and significance. Students will also learn to apply these theories through close investigation and analysis of selected film and screen texts.  The theories examined will be selected from the following: semiotics, post-structuralism, feminist film theory, surrealist theory, psychoanalysis, postmodernism, phenomenology, audience reception studies, and film materialist approaches. Students will also be trained in disciplinary skills, such as close textual analysis, research, literature reviews and the presentations of papers."
