    "overview": [
        "There are numerous mathematical methods used to obtain efficient solutions to a large variety of complex business problems.  This subject provides students with the ability to formulate a business problem as a mathematical model, and then to use quantitative techniques to identify a solution to the model.  Topics covered include linear programming, duality, integer programming, mixed integer programming, non-linear programming, Monte Carlo simulations, decision trees, expected value of perfect information, sample information and control, and sensitivity analysis."
