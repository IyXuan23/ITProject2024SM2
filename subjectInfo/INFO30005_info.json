        "When designing for today\u2019s devices, we still focus on smartphone and web applications. But what about the devices of tomorrow? This subject will explore design techniques and technologies for future devices, which are increasingly moving away from traditional screen-based interaction. We will consider design strategies and implications for novel technology settings, such as virtual and augmented reality, smart homes, autonomous vehicles, and voice interfaces. Students will learn to extend their current design practices to cover off-screen interaction, while also learning modern prototyping techniques to envision future interactive technologies.",
        "This is a practical, project-based subject, in which students will follow an iterative design process for designing a new user experience. Lectures and workshops will offer practical tools, techniques, and processes for prototyping these experiences."
