    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to establish an understanding of how chemical and biochemical engineering principles can be applied to the sustainable production of chemical products. The subject will focus on the application of biological conversion processes, in particular the use of microorganisms, and the conversion of renewable biomass feedstocks using chemical and biochemical pathways. This subject introduces students to the area of sustainable chemical production and bioprocessing, an area of growing importance to society.",
        "Topics covered will include: biochemistry of biological feedstocks; basic microbiology, cell structure and nutritional requirements; products from microbes and bioprocesses; cell growth kinetics and product formation; batch and continuous microbial growth and product formation; cellular maintenance energy and endogenous respiration; design of fermentation processes; bioreactor design and kinetics; industrial sterilisation & aseptic design; chemical conversion of biomass; biochemical separation processes."
