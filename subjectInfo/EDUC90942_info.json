    "overview": [
        "This subject is concerned with building a framework of knowledge to gain an understanding of educational organisations. The structure, organisation and culture of educational organisations are critically explored through the conceptual tool of framing. Leadership frameworks are used as a lens to explore structural, human resource, political and symbolic dimensions of organisations, whilst organisational behaviour focuses on the individual, group and system levels of an organisation. Students apply these concepts to a situation of professional interest."
