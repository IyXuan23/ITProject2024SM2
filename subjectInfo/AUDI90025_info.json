    "overview": [
        "This subject will provide an overview of the multiple determinants of communication skill development across the human lifespan, ranging from communication development in the prenatal period and early infancy through to communication changes that occur with ageing. The many facets of communication will be addressed including: What is communication? How do we communicate? What distinguishes human communication from other communication? What are the theories and origins of human communication? In this subject, you will be introduced to the idea that communication changes across the lifespan. We will address how communication competency develops and changes during early infancy through to old age. The many factors/ determinants that can impact on, or change, communication skills will be highlighted. Maintenance of communication across the lifespan will also be introduced within this context, as well as factors which impact on communication breakdown. You will apply your knowledge gained in this subject to analyse examples of human communication and to produce an essay on a selected communication topic."
