    "overview": [
        "Students undertaking this subject must complete three modules. The first module will introduce the concept of modern biomedical research through a number of breakthrough publications in the biochemistry and pharmacology fields. Students will learn how to communicate the significance of these publications to a non-specialist but scientifically educated audience in the written form.",
        "A second professional skills module will teach students skills in scientific communication. Students will prepare an abstract and poster describing a methodology used in biochemistry or pharmacology research, discussing the contents of the poster with their peers.",
        "A third module will cover frontier topics in biochemistry and analytical pharmacology. There will be lectures from experts in the field and students will learn how to critically evaluate scientific manuscripts, design experiments and implement appropriate statistical approaches.",
        "This subject is taken together with BIOM40001 Introduction to Biomedical Research."
