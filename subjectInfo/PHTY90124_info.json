    "overview": [
        "Healthcare in Context will develop students\u2019 knowledge and skills through community engagement. This will include campus-based and online learning as well as face-to-face engagement with a community.",
        "Students will work in small groups with an identified community to build on their knowledge of the determinants of health and to complete a health needs analysis. Students will specifically learn theory relating to the selection of ethically and culturally safe \u2018needs analysis\u2019 instruments that will inform them on the health and wellness priorities of the community. Students will critically apply this knowledge to their community engagement to implement the needs analysis instruments with key stakeholders from their community. Students will join their community for three-weeks of face-to-face engagement to complete elements of the health needs analysis and support a health promotion activity.  Communities may have a local, rural, remote and/or global footprint."
