    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to prepare students for the processes and strategies at the core of modern biomedical research. Using self-directed learning strategies, students will be guided through a series of online modules to serve as preparation for their own research projects. Modules on ethical considerations in biomedical research, data integrity and legislation, will equip students to consider these in the context of their own research. Students will learn about the importance of accurate research records, data documentation, and effective reference management including the use of an electronic laboratory notebook and reference management software. Real-world examples will be used to introduce experimental design and core statistical techniques enabling students to plan experiments and analyse their own data. Regular participation in a journal club will develop students\u2019 ability to critically appraise aspects of experimental design and data analysis and visualisation while resources developed by expert scientific communicators will aid students communicate their research, in both written and oral form, to a lay audience."
