        "Italian 3 is designed for students with some prior knowledge, or experience, of the language, spoken and/or written. The focus in this subject is on developing students\u2019 ability to understand text and, through an approach which privileges listening and reading, students further develop their understanding of the Italian language. A series of lectures on key aspects of Italian language and culture supports this development. Through an online virtual exchange, students have the opportunity to put their language abilities to use in an authentic context with young people of a similar age in Italy. By the end of the semester, students will have attained a moderate level of complexity in speaking, listening, reading and writing of Italian, allowing them to expand their ability to engage in discussion, as well as to read, understand and produce a range of texts."
