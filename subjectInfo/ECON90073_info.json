    "overview": [
        "The Economics Thesis Workshop Part 1 and Part 2 involves a two-semester program of study, (commencing in Semester 1 and completed in one calendar year). The preparation of the academic research paper is unsupervised but each student will be allocated an advisor to whom they can address questions. Students will be required to conduct and present the results of this independent piece of economic research at the end of the second semester.",
        "This subject serves as important preparation towards confirmation. Accordingly, a number of seminars and workshops will be held during the year to discuss various aspects of the program including bibliographic and other resources available to students. Amongst other things, the workshops provide a forum for students to discuss and develop their own research proposals.",
        "All students are also expected to attend at least one a week of the several professional academic seminars/workshops run in the Department of Economics. From this, students learn how academics create economics knowledge and participate in the academic community.",
        "Students in the second year of their Master of Commerce (Economics) Degree will be enrolled in this annual subject."
