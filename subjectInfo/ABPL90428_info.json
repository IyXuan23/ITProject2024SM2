    "overview": [
        "This subject explores evidence\u2010based planning and design practices for health and wellbeing. Derived from translational medicine, the approach seeks to access rigorous, robust and peer reviewed examples of evidence\u2010based design practices which exist in not only the architectural and urban planning sectors but also through environmental psychology, population health, health planning, biophilic and biourbanism experiences and related case studies. Cultural and creative practices including aspects of Australian indigenous knowledges further contribute to the learning content. The subject is informed by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) which is the leading international tool for advancing health and wellbeing in the built environment."
