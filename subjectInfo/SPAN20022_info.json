        "This subject is aimed at enabling students to substantially advance in their learning of Spanish language and Hispanic cultures, while also providing them with opportunities to develop workplace skills. In this subject, students will analyse sophisticated canonical and non-canonical texts that emerged from the major Spanish and Latin American literary movements. Advanced knowledge of the Spanish language will be promoted by studying, analysing and understanding texts such as short stories, theatre, poetry and essays. Students will study advanced Spanish language structures, such as complex verbal forms (e.g. subjunctive mode) and complex sentence structures, through textual analysis, essay writing, oral presentation and in-class discussion.Academic skills are enhanced through learning how to write scholarly essays in Spanish and to do close readings in a variety of genres, while oral skills are improved through individual and group presentations."
