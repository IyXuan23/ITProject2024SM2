    "overview": [
        "This subject will investigate the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the global carbon cycle and in a changing climate. Students will learn the scientific basis for climate change and the impact that a changing climate might have on terrestrial ecosystems and how ecosystems influence climate. We will learn what adaptation actions we can take to manage ecosystems in a changing climate. We will discuss the role ecosystems play in the global carbon cycle and the degree to which terrestrial ecosystems can be used as a carbon sequestration options. We will evaluate the requirements for forest carbon accounting and will apply carbon accounting tools in hands-on accounting sessions with industry partners. This scientific understanding will be extended to discuss policy instruments under consideration in Australia and in the international arena for the potential role of ecosystems in carbon emissions trading. The subject will equip students with state-of-the-art knowledge on the impact of climate change on forest ecosystems and with practical experiences in forest carbon accounting."
