    "overview": [
        "This subject will develop clinical reasoning skills in the management of paediatric conditions and focuses on overall patient management and education rather than 'hands-on' physiotherapy treatment. Students have a two-week clinical placement block which may include attending the Royal Children's Hospital or associated clinics in Melbourne. Interstate students will be able to attend clinical placements closer to home. The two-week placement block will include clinically-relevant online tutorials. Students will prepare a case study for presentation at the end of the clinical placement block and submit assignments throughout the remainder of the semester. Case presentations will be conducted  online."
