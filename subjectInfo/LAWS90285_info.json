    "overview": [
        "The law of privacy is one of the fastest-developing fields in the law across the world. It has critical relevance to the media and to the freedom of the media to report on matters of serious public interest and concern.",
        "This subject will consider, analyse and critique both the current and developing law, not just in Australia but across other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, Canada, NZ and the United States. We will consider whether the appropriate balance is struck, in both liability and remedies. The current direct and indirect protection of privacy \u2013 at common law and under statute \u2013 will be considered. We take a comparative perspective in our critical analysis of proposals for law reform.",
