    "overview": [
        "Drawing from the lean principles originating in the Toyota Production System (TPS), lean practices have gained popularity in the construction industry (known as lean construction). Lean construction enhances value on projects and uncovers wasted resources. It has the potential to help owner organisations, contractors, and subcontractors to realise improvements in project delivery\u2014including in terms of cost, schedule, quality, and productivity. This subject aims to develop students\u2019 knowledge and understanding of lean construction as a philosophy, a bundle of lean tools, and a problem-solving culture which forms the lean construction body of knowledge. Key topics include lean philosophy, lean tools, and lean practices, and how they apply to construction in a national and international context."
