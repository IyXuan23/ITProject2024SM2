        "Supervised field education provides a focused practice learning experience. Students will learn to integrate social work theory, knowledge, values, and practice, develop practice skills, increase their knowledge of the interface between policy, research and evidence-based practice and increase their understanding of the organisational contexts and fields of practice. The first placement is comprised of two subjects taken consecutively: SCWK90048 Supervised Field Placement 1A and SCWK90049 Supervised Field Placement 1B. This subject constitutes the first half (250 hours) of the first supervised field placement required within the Master of Social Work course."
