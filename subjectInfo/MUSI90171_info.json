        "This practicum is the third of a suite of four subjects that focus on different productions, in different languages, which take place in a range of contexts. While the assessments are necessarily very similar across all 4 practicums, each will vary according to the demands of the practical work undertaken and the student\u2019s place in the sequence. This practicum represents the third stage of development.",
