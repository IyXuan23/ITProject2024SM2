    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to provide students an overview of the current Japanese writing system, consisting of three types of script:kanji, hiraganaandkatakana. Students will learn the historical backgrounds of these types of script, and learn the current structural and functional characteristics of each type of script in writings by analysing how it is used in writings. Students will have opportunities to observe the recent changes in the use of the script and other signs and symbols, and analyse their functions in relation to other words. Students who complete this subject will gain knowledge of Japanese words, and develop skills for the accurate comprehension and appropriate reproduction of the words in reading and writing."
