    "aims": [
        "Students will learn how to structure and work with engineering contracts to deliver and procure engineering outcomes in this subject. Students will develop a working knowledge of contract administration and gain an understanding of commercial aspects of engineering. All engineers interface commercially with engineering contracts throughout their careers, and thus the application of the subject content is broad. Those seeking to work as a contractor and as a contract administrator will find a direct application of this subject\u2019s content. Students will learn how to use procurement and contracts to develop successful engineering projects. This includes administration of the contracts and understanding the business environment where these contracts are agreed. These skills will be useful to students in their future work and apply to a wide range of engineering disciplines."

            "LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODSThe subject is based principally on presentations by experienced industry and academic professionals who present the theory and practices of engineering procurement and contracts as illustrated by project case studies and example situations from real projects. A computer simulation game is undertaken whereby students compete by bidding for and managing projects as if they are the management team for a major contractor. This game is based on a UK company and provides key learning\u2019s and feedback on the interface between engineering contracting and corporate management. Students also critique a real Australian request for tender via an assignment.INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCESExtensive course notes are provided on LMS.Australian Standard General Conditions of Contract provides a base document for the contract administrative section of the course and AS/NZS 4300 (the general conditions of contract for design and contract projects) is appropriate. This standard is available via the library using the database section of the library (search for SAI Global \u2013 Australian Standards and then follow prompt to 4300 via the standards search engine).CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKSPresenters from industry provide insights via the case studies presented. The computer simulation is based on real industry practice and is the same simulation game run internationally for consultants and contractors. The main case study dissected throughout the subject is a real and current project."
