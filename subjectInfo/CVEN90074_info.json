    "overview": [
        "21stcentury - geotechnical engineering is undergoing a revolution, embracing the strength of computer-based site characterisation, investigation and performance analysis methods. Site-specific computer simulations elucidate the pros and cons of long-standing empirically established engineering solutions and finally permit their rigorous scientific analysis. New algorithms and hardware enable the simulation of complex interacting subsurface processes even in intricate structures. In concert with much improved measurement, imaging, modelling and visualisation tools, \u201cmultiphysics\u201d simulation software greatly increase the ability of engineers to get accurate answers to What-If? engineering design questions.",
        "This subject provides the essential foundations for an informed, successful and effective application of process simulation software that now gets routinely applied in geotechnical engineering projects, site investigation, and performance and risk assessment of engineering measures.",
        "The subject covers essentials like the formulation of conceptual models for subsurface (heat flow, fluid flow, geomechanics), numeric modelling techniques, development, programming and incorporation of constitutive relationships, construction and parameterisation of site-specific models, experimental design of simulations (numeric experiments), and visualisation and analysis of results.",
        "Theoretical foundations are applied in hands-on model building \u2013 configuration \u2013 calibration - simulation \u2013 analysis exercises conducted with freely available and commercial software tools, including proprietary ones used by industry."
