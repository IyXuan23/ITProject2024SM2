    "overview": [
        "Integrated Professional Practice B will prepare students for diverse practice and an evolving physiotherapy career. This subject includes both on-campus and online learning, in addition to two clinical placements: a Future Career selective and a Work Readiness placement.",
        "Building upon previous DPT learning and the DPT graduate attributes, this subject provides opportunities to extend, deepen, and apply knowledge, skills, and attributes. Students will focus on collaborative interprofessional practice, and implementation and evaluation of management plans that are responsive to the individual, systems of health and community care, and the environment.",
        "Students will have an opportunity to select two from a choice of modules, for example advanced rehabilitation, rural health and private practice, and which align with their specific area of interest. The Future Career selective placement may additionally provide opportunities for students to choose a clinical, research, or professional practice placement in line with their specific area of interest as well as the opportunity for international based placements.",
        "To further build and enhance transitional skills, knowledge, and attributes necessary for practice as physiotherapists, students will review the Australian and New Zealand Physiotherapy Council Practice thresholds, Codes of Conduct, and professional registration requirements.",
        "Students will curate their ePortfolio assets and resources collected across the three years of the Doctor of Physiotherapy program, to produce and present a professional ePortfolio, which provides a reflective, critical and creative opportunity to demonstrate their learning journey and readiness for transition to practice."
