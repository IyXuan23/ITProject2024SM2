    "overview": [
        "Business analytics involves the use of data to support business decision-making. Managing investments in business analytics, initiating business analytics programs, and knowing how to tailor programs and tools for specific business analytics needs are import skills in modern organizations. The course aims at teaching students about key business analytics tools and initiating and supervising business analytics programs from a managerial/consulting perspective.",
        "Indicative Content",
        "This subject introduces the concepts of business analytics, decision making, data warehouse design, data warehouse modelling, data quality, data warehouse implementation - including the extract-transform-load (ETL) process, and data warehouse use in supporting business analytics \u2013 including decision making tools and OLAP. Readings are provided for all topics that introduce real world cases on business analytics and related areas and include the use of business analytics in organisations.",
        "The subject also explores how organisations gather and generate multiple forms of information, and how this information is analysed and converted into useful knowledge via individual judgement and organisational learning processes. In applying empirical and analytical approaches to practical situations, students will develop insights into both the nature of the business problems as well as methods that are used for identifying and evaluating alternative solutions. The subject content will include conceptual foundations, practical tools, and case studies to discuss the costs, benefits and risks of the various analytical methods that will be introduced."
