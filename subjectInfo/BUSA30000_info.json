        "This subject serves as a capstone for the Management and Marketing majors within the Bachelor of Commerce. As such, the aim is to integrate students\u2019 knowledge of core business functions and analytical tools and apply these to the problems faced by modern organisations and decision-makers. Students will be exposed to these problems through simulation tasks and case analyses. Students will be challenged to form and act upon judgments around strategic directions, marketing priorities, and entrepreneurial opportunities. There is a strong focus on the need to collectively arrive at decisions within decision groups, and to argue for these choices through typical business communication formats (e.g. business plans, slide packs, formalised reviews)."
