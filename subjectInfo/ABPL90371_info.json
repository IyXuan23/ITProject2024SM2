    "overview": [
        "This elective subject will explore the dynamics and effectiveness of architecture in relation to the politics of protest. It will link together concepts from critical theory, community development, and urban futures with architectural design. To do this the subject will use contemporary case studies to explore the relationship of architectural design to different forms of activism and protest. These case studies will include perspectives from both international and local case studies, and students will be encouraged to develop their own international perspectives. Case studies will include the Occupy movement, Anonymous and other modes of civil disobedience, as well as local case studies including the East-West link and anti Coal Seam Gas protests.",
        "Through this subject students will research how architectural propositions can change the way we protest and the way we respond to protests and protestors. The subject will bring together various ABP academics and practitioners involved in the interfaces between alternative architecture, protest and the contradictions of power in relation to urban infrastructures."
