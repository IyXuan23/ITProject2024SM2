    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on how to access and understand basic climate science and data and how to accurately communicate to a broader audience. The subject covers the fundamentals of climate science, including the physics and chemistry of climate change, future climate projections, climate extremes, and the interactions between the atmosphere and land, forests and the oceans. The subject also interrogates how global changes in climate lead to impacts on society, ecosystems, and economies. The subject has a particular focus on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. To develop practical skills, students will make use of these scientific reports and concepts learnt in class to prepare short assessments that clearly and concisely communicate and translate aspects of climate science. The course culminates in a negotiation session where students take on the role of a state representative within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
