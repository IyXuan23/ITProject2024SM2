    "overview": [
        "This subject will be conducted predominantly in the clinical setting and will provide students with an opportunity to develop their clinical skills and to integrate their theoretical knowledge in cardiorespiratory physiotherapy clinical practice. The emphasis in this subject is the application of clinical reasoning and evidence-based practice in the safe and effective assessment and management of individuals with cardiorespiratory conditions in the clinical setting. This will apply in, communication, therapeutic interventions, advocacy and education working as a health professional within a team, with individuals and their carers, respecting their rights and choices within the healthcare setting."

        "To integrate knowledge of cardiorespiratory physiotherapy, common cardiorespiratory conditions and the framework for clinical reasoning to the assessment and management of individuals with cardiorespiratory conditions",
        "To implement the theoretical framework for clinical reasoning in cardiorespiratory assessment, treatment and rehabilitation, selecting appropriate assessments, problems, goals and approaches to treatment in the clinical setting",
        "To select, justify and demonstrate safe and effective physiotherapeutic interventions to address impairments and activity limitations in individuals with acute and chronic cardiorespiratory conditions",
        "To safely and effectively execute and interpret cardiorespiratory assessment techniques, including observational movements analysis, objective measures of impairment, activity limitations and participation restrictions",
        "Incorporate findings from high-quality clinical research and patient assessment findings when managing patients with cardiorespiratory conditions",
        "Recommend the most effective cardiorespiratory physiotherapy treatment techniques using the principles of evidence-based practice",
        "Demonstrate an understanding of the patients/clients rights and the cultural preferences that shape their healthcare preferences, incorporating them into practice within the institutional constraints",
        "Identify the factors critical to effective time and resource management in the clinical setting and implement strategies addressing these factors within individual treatment sessions and caseload management"
