    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the \u201cphysical\u201d and \u201cdigital\u201d infrastructures of transport systems. This includes not just the infrastructure that facilitates the efficient and safe movement of passenger cars, but also the design and planning concepts related to multimodal transport options and new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and connected transport systems. As such in addition to highway geometric design, pavement design, bridge, and tunnel design, this subject would also include public transport infrastructure design, intelligent transport systems, and connected and automated vehicle infrastructures of the future. This subject presents a comprehensive introduction to transport careers and multidisciplinary opportunities for students after graduation.",
