        "In this subject, students will critically evaluate the role of clinical ultrasound in its application to the preoperative patient. They will interpret cardiovascular and other investigations used to risk stratify patients prior to surgery, and assess how these impact on perioperative planning. They will evaluate how best to optimise the patient condition prior to surgery, including appraisal of preoperative management of cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal and hepatic, neurological and psychiatric conditions and the role of clinical ultrasound in these settings."
