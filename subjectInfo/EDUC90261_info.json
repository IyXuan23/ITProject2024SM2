        "This subject investigates the role and structure of the Primary Years Programme curriculum framework. Participants will explore how learners construct meaning, including how understanding is acquired and what differentiates it from knowledge. There will be a strong theoretical component as well as a critical evaluation of the development and implementation of curriculum that is intended to support the integration of the Essential Elements. Strategies for supporting the development of higher order thinking skills, including the role of student-directed concept-driven inquiry, the art of inquiring, and building communities of learners will be investigated. There will also be a practical emphasis on the development and implementation of a concept driven transdisciplinary curriculum."
