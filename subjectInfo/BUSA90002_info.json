        "Accounting is the \u201clanguage of business,\u201d and accounting information is the basis for performance measurement, business contracting, and most operating, investing, and financing decisions that managers make. Financial accounting information affects how individuals outside a company perceive that company, and by extension, the resources available to the company to accomplish its objectives. An understanding of and the ability to use financial accounting information will be essential to your success as a professional manager. This subject is designed to provide students with foundation knowledge about external financial reporting by for-profit entities. This foundation knowledge not only provides the basis for correctly interpreting and using accounting information provided internally to managers for managerial decision making, but also provides the basis for using financial statements for more externally-focused judgments and decisions (e.g., assessing a firm\u2019s intrinsic value or to assess a firm\u2019s strengths and weaknesses relative to competitors)."
