The subject combines a study of history, theory, and practice to consider the development of cultural industries and the growing demands of working collaboratively internationally and across cultures. The approach to the material is through lectures, readings, class discussions, and case studies relating to cultural industries and organisations from around the globe, which may include festivals, museums, art galleries, and film. Students completing this subject will gain a better understanding of the diverse global, regional, and national contexts for the dynamic arts and cultural sector as well as a cross-cultural and international outlook."
