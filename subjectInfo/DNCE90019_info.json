    "overview": [
        "This subject enables students to undertake an independent research project on a topic of their choice in consultation with tutors. As a capstone project, this subject enables students to apply their skills and knowledge across discipline boundaries and to develop a sustained critical and creative process with a written and practical outcome.",
        "The Research Project may be a choreographic portfolio, a case study, exegesis or mixed mode event. It locates the research in relation to current issues, developments and perspectives in dance scholarship, practice and related disciplines. The subject provides an opportunity for students to pursue a particular interest, related to the material covered on the taught programme, which also extends beyond the knowledge acquired in other subjects.",
        "It promotes independent thinking and originality in the application of new paradigms and existing knowledge. It develops and tests students' knowledge of research methods, their cognitive skills in synthesising and evaluating sources and materials and practical skills in information searching, documentation, performing, processing and research management.",
        "The Research Project functions, where relevant, as preparation and pathway to Research at a Higher Degree."
