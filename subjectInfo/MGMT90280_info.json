        "With the explosion of data, it is critical that businesses harness the right analytical tools to make effective use of the available data. This subject is designed to equip students with a range of tools and techniques that are necessary for effective decision making. Key topics covered include both prescriptive analytics (e.g., linear optimisation, nonlinear optimisation, and Monte Carlo simulation) and predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting, logistic regression, classification and regression trees). Emphasis will be given to potential applications of these tools and techniques in various functional areas including international business, marketing, supply chain, and strategy."
