        "Students will learn about the mechanical behaviour and structure of materials, from the continuum  modelling of properties to  the microscopic origin of the behaviour with reference to available and  appropriate multiscale modelling techniques.",
        "The subject will cover the microstructure\u2010property relation in elastic and plastic deformation, timedependent deformation (creep)and failure in materials with emphasis on engineering materials. The  diverse mechanical behaviour will be discussed for differentmaterials classes, including metals, functional materials, architectured materials, composites and polymers."
