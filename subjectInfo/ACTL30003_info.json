        "This subject introduces various insurance and annuity products, teaches fundamental knowledge of actuarial pricing and reserving, and discusses techniques used for projecting and valuing insurance and annuity cashflows which are contingent on the status of single or multiple lives. Actuarial modelling of insurance products is taught and explored using spreadsheets in realistic contexts."
