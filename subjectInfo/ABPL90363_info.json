        "Property Research and Analysis is a taught module that draws on theories and techniques to analyse various property-related research questions in an applied way through selected research-based studies demonstrating how these theories and techniques are applied. The specific focus on research in this subject provides the foundation for ABPL90362 Research Thesis \u2013 Property.",
        "The subject has two aims:",
        "The subject concentrates on the preliminary stages of research, from defining a research question through to planning and beginning implementation of the research. The output of students' work constitutes the basis for the empirical work conducted in ABPL90362 Research Thesis - Property and forms an integral part of the final research report of that subject.",
        "Together ABPL90363 Property Research Analysis and ABPL90362 Research Thesis - Property meet the 25-point research pathway to PhD requirement.",
