        "Collaboration is at the heart of design for both stage design and production design for screen. Students will identify and implement methods for collaboratively developing their designs with the technicians who will contribute to their realisation.",
        "In developing these skills, students will be working and interacting with others involved in realising productions for either the stage or the screen. Collaborators may include artisans, managers, technicians and other designers. Students will develop practical skills in producing their designs and integrate a sophisticated understanding of the processes required to achieve designs in a professional context into their practice."
