        "This subject looks at the design and planning of events in various forms.",
        "It explores opening ceremonies, public parades, marches and celebrations, static installations in public spaces, events in festivals, temporary venues built in public spaces and immersive environments, whereby city spaces and structures are repurposed for performance.",
        "The subject examines how designers, employing the medium of public event and spectacle, reimagine public space, taking something familiar and transforming it into something surprising, unexpected and remarkable providing a context for the student to develop their own hypothetical, ephemeral design project in a series of six design studios."
