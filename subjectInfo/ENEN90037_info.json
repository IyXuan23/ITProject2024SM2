    "aims": [
        "River basins, where human civilisation comes from, are challenged by increasing population pressures, rapid urbanization and climate change impact. A river basin is a semi-closed ecological and economic system, representing logical management units of the water cycle, throughout which all decisions and actions have interdependent ecological, social and economic implications. Thus, river basin management needs interdisciplinary knowledge. This subject aims to equip tomorrow\u2019s water managers with the adaptive approach by linking cutting edge knowledge to stress-tested practices in river basin management.",
        "This subject includes (a) 10 weeks of classroom teaching during the semester (2 hours of lectures and 1 hour of tutorial each week) and (b) a 5-7 day field trip held in either China or Australia. Students are responsible for the cost of travel, accommodation and food."
