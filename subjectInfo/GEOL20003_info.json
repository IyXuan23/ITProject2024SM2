    "overview": [
        "How does our planet evolve over time? What is its interior like? These questions were first addressed by looking at rocks, and the study of rocks remains a vibrant field within the geosciences. In this subject you will discover the astonishing diversity and complexity of rocks that appear on Earth\u2019s surface. You will learn to read the stories of planetary change that these rocks record\u2013whether they formed during volcanic eruptions, at the hearts of mountain belts, or in ancient tropical seas.",
        "The Subject emphasises the practical scientific skills of detailed observation, accurate description, informative classification, and reasoned interpretation. You will develop these skills in the laboratory, and apply them during a field excursion to the Western Victoria Volcanics District."
