    "overview": [
        "This subject explores critical perspectives on digital platforms within media and communications studies. Digital platforms incorporate databases, algorithms, interfaces and infrastructures, and now play a significant role in mediating digital economies, cultural practices and social relations. Students will examine various theoretical, historical and methodological approaches for analyzing digital platforms, including their histories and social impacts. Within the subject workshops, students will consider debates around technology innovation, change and adoption, whilst also undertaking a research project to apply these ideas to a specific feature or function of a digital platform."
