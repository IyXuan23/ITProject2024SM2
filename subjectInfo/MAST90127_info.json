    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on your knowledge of how biological modelling provides insight into complex biological phenomena. With a focus on mechanistic modelling and viewing biological systems as dynamic in nature, you will learn how to develop and implement \u201creal-world\u201d models, applicable to current open problems in computational biology. Advanced approaches to model-based analysis of data will be introduced, including Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Software languages and packages for modelling and statistical analysis (e.g. SBML and STAN) will be introduced. Motivating problems will be drawn from across the spectrum of biology from genetics to ecology."
