        "This subject provides students with the tools and skills necessary to devise and conduct professional research in music at graduate level. Through group discussions and peer review sessions students will engage with the key principles of research and academic writing and apply them to a context relevant to them.",
        "Students will be supported in defining and focusing their research questions, developing a critical summary of the literature, constructing an adequate conceptual framework, adhering to and meeting deadlines, and presenting their work persuasively, both in oral and written form. The main outcome will be a full research project that could potentially serve as the basis of an application for a graduate program."
