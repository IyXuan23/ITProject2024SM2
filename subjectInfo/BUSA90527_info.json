They work throughout the digital product lifecycle, from the beginning steps of writing product requirements documents, through the tradeoffs and prioritisation during development, to the delivery of the digital products to users, and its subsequent improvement through iteration. Along the way, they are the communicators and evangelists that work up, across and inside the organisation to ensure information flows effectively.",
