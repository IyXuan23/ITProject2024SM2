Students will attend at least 10 festival screenings and required industry talks* and reflect upon these events in tutorials spread throughout the festival duration.",
        "*Some of these events may be curated (i.e., pre-determined by the subject coordinator) and others will be free choice. Cost of attendance at the festival is the student's responsibility. Most industry talks are free.",
        "This subject will incur costs in addition to tuition fees.",
