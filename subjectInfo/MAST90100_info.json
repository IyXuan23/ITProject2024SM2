    "overview": [
        "This subject covers the fundamental theory of probability and statistical inference that is needed as a foundation for understanding and practice of the core methods of biostatistics, understood as the science of drawing conclusions from data in health and medical investigations. Major topics include fundamental concepts of probability and distributions, including simulation of hypothetical data, and key concepts of statistical estimation and hypothesis testing, including sampling variability, confidence intervals, likelihood functions and an introduction to the Bayesian approach to inference. The approach emphasizes a critical understand\u00ading of the role of statistical inference in health research."
