        "This subject covers the principles of general practice as well as specialty areas of periodontology, prosthodontics, endodontics, paediatric dentistry and orthodontics.",
        "Topics include local analgesia, treatment planning, cariology, dental materials, periodontal management and the oral rehabilitation of hard tissues and missing teeth, including the concept of the life cycle of a restoration, longevity of restorations and advanced management options.",
        "The basic principles of root canal treatment of teeth will be covered in the Endodontic component. Prosthodontics will include removable (denture) and fixed (crown and bridge) components. Paediatric dentistry and orthodontic components will cover concepts of growth and development in diagnosis, planning and management; as well as topics specific to management of the young patient."
