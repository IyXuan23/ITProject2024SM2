    "overview": [
        "This subject is a continuation of Chinese 5. It is designed for students of non-Chinese speaking background who have completed Chinese 5 (previously offered as Chinese 3A), or equivalent. Students will build on the knowledge gained through their previous studies and broaden their reading, listening comprehension, speaking and writing skills.Students will develop their ability to communicate in Chinese at a beginning-advanced level and their analytical skills of the Chinese language through engaging with a range of topics concerning contemporary Chinese society and culture. Their linguistic competence will be further enhanced through exposure to Chinese materials dealing with a variety of socio-cultural situations, writing and presenting opinion pieces on current issues in Chinese, and participating in group discussions. Study activities will be supported with linguistic and cultural resources, including background information in brief English passages, as well as video, audio and additional reading materials introducing the cultural topics.This subject will allow students to gain confidence and independence in handling written Chinese language materials so as to make the transition from textbook material to original Chinese texts."
