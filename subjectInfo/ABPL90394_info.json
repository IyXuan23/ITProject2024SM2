        "This subject is an intensive 5-day workshop that encompasses a series of lectures on zero energy mass custom home (ZEMCH) design and function analysis techniques, as well as hands-on trainings of energy and environmental design simulation tools for implementation during the workshop.The ZEMCH Sustainable Design Workshop will consist of:",
        "Knowledge transfer activities;",
        "Design demonstration site visit and function analysis;",
        "Design code and housing prototype development;",
        "Energy and environmental design simulation and mass custom design development; and",
        "Data collation and presentation.",
        "The workshop will be carried out on the University campus. Victorian homebuilder/housing manufacturer will be invited to the workshop whose learning outcomes will be presented in the form of four group oral presentations and one A0 size group poster submission. Prior to the workshop, students are requested to read a textbook that packages ZEMCH engineering design knowledge related to: (1) Sustainable development; (2) Mass housing; (3) Prefabrication; (4) Mass customisation; (5) Mass personalisation; (6) Inclusive design; (7) Energy use in housing; (8) Passive design; (9) Active technologies; (10) Zero energy homes; (11) Building performance and simulation; and (12) Business operation. Along with the workshop experience, the knowledge gained through the pre-teaching ZEMCH textbook reading will be tested by means of a 2h examination.",
