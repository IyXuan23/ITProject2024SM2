    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces participants to recruitment and selection in medical and surgical education. Entry to surgical practice is highly competitive. The profession has a responsibility to ensure that those who enter surgical training are those who are best suited. Current approaches to selection have been challenged. Internationally, there has been significant shift in methods. There are tensions in recruitment that include the need to increase diversity of trainees.",
        "In this subject, a broad range of recruitment and selection approaches will be explored highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Best practice in human resource management will be explored. We draw on practices in business and management including a range of psychometric tests and their acceptability and suitability for entry to surgical training. Further, attention will be given to the history of dexterity, visuo-spatial and other abilities relevant for the unique nature of surgical practice.",
        "The subject will review selections systems from around the world research findings on validation including candidate, surgeon and patient reactions. Where training panels are used, issues in their performance will be considered.",
        "We will also investigate selection methods for medical school which vary widely and for which there is a substantial and growing body of evidence. The widespread introduction of graduate entry medicine may have implications for entry to speciality training. The subject also reviews the extensive literature on career intention.",
        "The subject advances also students\u2019 knowledge of assessment in designing and selecting appropriate tests for selection. Additionally, students will be able to locate selection in the spectrum of curriculum activity \u2013 that is, from selection, through curriculum implementation (including assessment) and evaluation.",
        "Overall aims:",
        "To provide participants with an understanding of best practice in recruitment and selection",
        "To provide an understanding of selection criteria and methods for measuring behaviours"
