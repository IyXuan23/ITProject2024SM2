        "This subject focuses on the concept of modernity in culture and society, particularly as it fashioned the art of the later nineteenth century and twentieth century with a wave of successive avant-gardes, and which we identify as \u201cmodernism\u201d.",
        "Students will explore language and methods for critically describing and interpreting works of art, using examples from the modern era. Through study of select works of art, students examine historical, social, cultural and political contexts.",
        "Developing from Critical and Theoretical Studies 1, this subject introduces more advanced modes of critical interpretation of the visual arts. Critical and Theoretical Studies 2 includes an embedded program in academic literacy skills in analysis, discussion, essay writing, research and information retrieval, and is designed to complement accompanying studio-based programs."
