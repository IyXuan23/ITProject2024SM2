        "This unit aims to explore the relationship between physical and psychological health and illness. The key components of this relationship will be explored from both a theoretical and clinical perspective. These concepts include how psychological factors affect physical health, how physical illness can lead to psychological disturbance and the nature of somatisation. Common medical conditions with psychological associations will also be reviewed.",
        "The activities of psychiatrists within general medical settings will be explored. This will include the clinical process of the consultation liaison assesment, the application of neuropsychological testing and the nature of interventions. Issues of communication, treatment adherence and relationship difficulties in medical settings will be addressed."
