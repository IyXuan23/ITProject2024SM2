Teacher Candidates will reflect critically on the ways in which educational theory and research inform practice.",
        "The school placement is focused on clinical teaching across all curriculum areas and year levels in a generalist primary classroom. Teacher Candidates will demonstrate capacity to make sound clinical judgements and to independently deliver high impact clinical instruction for sustained periods using sequenced lessons and units of work. Teacher Candidates will demonstrate a high level of 21st century skills and their ability to develop these skills in students. Teacher Candidates will differentiate their teaching to include students with diverse needs and backgrounds and will take into account Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives on learning and development. Experienced Mentor Teachers support Teacher Candidates in collaboration with academics who are also engaged in the on-campus teaching program.",
        "The Clinical Teaching Practice seminars are framed by the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at the Graduate Level. At seminars, Teacher Candidates will engage in collaborative learning and critical reflection."
