        "In this subject each student is required to define and explore a specific area or activity in their chosen practice that underpins their work as artists and researchers.

        "Whether through the development of a short musical theatre work, the exploration of a relevant technique or the pursuit of any other crucial aspect of contemporary Music Theatre practice, this subject offers the student an opportunity to create a major work that tests and progresses their creative and critical capacity as a practitioner.",
        "This subject aims to challenge and extend students' understanding and practice of Music Theatre and develop considerate, open, courageous, thinking artists.",
        "Travel",
        "Depending on the nature of the discipline and project, students may travel to undertake fieldwork where this aligns to the outcomes of their major project. Any travel undertaken is at the student's own expense."
