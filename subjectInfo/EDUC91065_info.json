    "overview": [
        "This subject supports Teacher Candidates to develop a deep understanding of assessment strategies, approaches and feedback and the relationships between these and engagement in learning. These understandings support Teacher Candidates to differentiate teaching to meet the learning needs of all children across the full range of abilities.",
        "Using the Clinical Teaching Model as a guiding framework, Teacher Candidates will learn about assessment strategies and approaches. These will consider the diverse needs and backgrounds of children so that accurate and actionable evidence of ability can be collected. Teacher Candidates will develop the ability to construct progressions of learning that are contextually relevant and aligned to the relevant Australian educational frameworks and curricula. They will learn how to use progressions as models of learning that can be used to interpret evidence and support diverse children to actively engage in learning and to reach their potential. Teacher Candidates will learn how to provide feedback that is culturally relevant, accessible, positively framed and engages children. They will review the effectiveness of their own teaching and critically reflect on their ability to evaluate children\u2019s progress.  Teacher Candidates will learn how to collect, interpret and use student assessment data to evaluate student learning and modify teaching practice.  Candidates will examine assessment moderation practices and its application to support consistent and comparable judgements of children\u2019s learning. Strategies for reporting to children/parents/carers and the purpose of keeping accurate and reliable records of children\u2019s achievement will also be examined.",
        "This subject includes a Clinical Teaching Practicum (placement) in a Primary school setting. During the placement, Teacher Candidates will begin to consolidate the nexus between theory and the practice of teaching, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research to support their teaching practice. Teacher Candidates are supported by experienced Clinical Specialists and Mentor Teachers. A series of seminars will be held which explore Candidates\u2019 developing professional knowledge, practice and engagement. In this subject Teacher Candidates will also complete a Clinical Praxis Exam."
