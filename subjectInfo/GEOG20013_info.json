        "Geography and health are intrinsically linked. This subject examines geographic approaches to the understanding of human health. Its primary purpose is to critically review the links between population health and place/location, including social, built and natural environments. Students will be introduced to different theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches for understanding geographies of health. The subject has particular focus on current health geography concerns including the spatial distribution of (re)emerging infectious diseases, population health impacts of climatic and environmental change, migrant health, neighbourhoods and health, and social and spatial distribution of health risks and vulnerabilities. These themes will be addressed through important case studies from both Australia and internationally."
