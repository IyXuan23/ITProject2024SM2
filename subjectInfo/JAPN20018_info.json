These may include topics such as Japan\u2019s aging society, education and language policies, gender equality, disaster relief and recovery, youth issues and fads/fashions. It compares the coverage of these issues in print and electronic media, including websites and television programming. Through project work and classroom discussions, students will analyse and engage with contemporary media. Students will also develop an understanding of media idioms and usage, culturally specific expressions and Japanese socio-cultural norms."
