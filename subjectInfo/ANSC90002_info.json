        "Formerly BIOL90021",
        "The subject examines the applications of new technologies in processing and analysis of feeds for a range of animal species. The subject will introduce empirical, mechanistic and telemetric models to evaluate animal performance under different dietary regimes. Furthermore, the implications of feed composition and evaluation on mechanistic modelling of nutrient uptake and utilisation by the animal will be assessed. The modelling procedures will also be used to evaluate wastage of C and N in animal production systems with special emphasis on the losses of C as methane and N as ammonia and nitrous oxides."
