    "overview": [
        "In this placement the supervisor, in conjunction with the Placement Coordinator, offers a designed set of training experiences which are undertaken with the supervisor. The training experience, undertaken with the supervisor, is built upon the activities observed in Practicum 1. The practicum placement is generally in the same location as Practicum 1. The experiences are determined by the opportunities that arise naturally in the field. The involvement of the student is judged by the supervisor. Generally, the student will engage in psychological practice that may include visits to educational sites, observing and conducting assessments, interviewing, delivering interventions, providing consultations, attending meetings, creating individual support plans, and reporting on their outcomes where appropriate.",
        "The placement provides the opportunity to carry out the tasks of an educational and developmental psychologist under supervision and in accordance with Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) professional competency standards. Opportunities to receive feedback are built into the task design. The placement provides an understanding of the breadth and depth of the role of the educational and developmental psychologist. It facilitates the development of an appreciation of complex professional issues, ethics, and identity. There are a series of lectures covering issues of professional practice, ethics, case formulation skills, report writing, supervision, and contemporary issues in educational and developmental psychology practice."
