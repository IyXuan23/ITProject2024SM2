    "overview": [
        "This subject covers key concepts related to the stereochemical and electronic properties of molecules and the methods central to their study. Important elements of the subject include the spectroscopic characterisation and quantification of materials by a range of spectroscopic techniques, molecular orbital techniques and the application of approaches based on molecular symmetry and group theory to the understanding of molecular properties, stereo-selective reactions, bonding and spectroscopy. These topics have applications to advanced materials, light emitting polymers, chemical analysis and catalysis in biological and industrial systems."

        "be able to apply molecular orbital theory to simple homo- and heteronuclear diatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules;",

        "be able to describe the changes in bonding that occur to small molecules (e.g. CO) on binding to a transition metal and to be able to apply these concepts to the catalysis of reactions of those species."
