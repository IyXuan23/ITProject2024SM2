    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to the awe-inspiring world of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The students will encounter the cutting-edge research of the academic staff of Classics and Archaeology in their respective fields of expertise. Students will explore the astonishing interconnectivity of the ancient world, the evolution of Greek and Roman civilizations, the close links between the ancient Near East and Greco-Roman culture, and the enduring global legacy of the Greco-Roman cultural and literary traditions.",
        "The subject will cover topics such as the early beginnings of Greek culture and traditions (the enduring impact on Greece of Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Minoan and Mycenaean cultures), the Homeric epics, Greek and Roman mythology, ancient theatre, Greek and Roman literary and artistic culture, the development of political constitutions (democracy, oligarchy and tyranny), social history, militarism and imperialism, and identities in Greece and Rome (the representation of foreigners, women, slaves and freedmen). The subject will also consider the ways in which modern Western culture has inherited and appropriated aspects of ancient civilisation, claiming it as a model in fields ranging from epic film and architectural design to political structure and imperial aspiration."
