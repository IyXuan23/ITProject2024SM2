        "This subject aims to provide students with an introduction to a range of technical examination and documentation methods.  Visual examination methods include the use of:  visible light (reflected, transmitted, raking), ultraviolet and infrared radiation and x-radiography.  More invasive examination methods include:  microscopy, sampling and chemical spot tests.  Documentation methods include:  photography, 3-D imaging, condition reporting and scientific report writing.  Students will apply these fundamental examination and documentation techniques to the study of:",
        "One focus object, which students will select and work on as a group.  Each student group will be investigating ether a painting (landscape or portrait), paper (watercolour, print or photograph) or object (textile, wood, ceramic, metal, glass or plastic) based artefact.",
        "A variety of cultural heritage objects composed of organic, inorganic or metallic materials will also be examined during the practical sessions, for a more holistic perspective.",
        "During the pre-teaching period students are expected to complete the course readings, review the online lectures and any other course preparation as outlined on the LMS, which will become available at the commencement of the pre-teaching dates."
