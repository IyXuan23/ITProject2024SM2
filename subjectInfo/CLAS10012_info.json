    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed for students with some previous knowledge of Latin (VCE level or equivalent). Students examine Roman rhetorical practice through the study of an oratorical text, such as a speech of Cicero. In addition, work is undertaken on grammar and syntax to revise, consolidate and extend students' knowledge of the language. Students who complete this subject should be familiar with the structures and stylistic techniques of Roman oratory, be able to identify the roles of rhetorical practice in Roman social and political life, and understand its function as an instrument of Roman elite self-definition. Students who complete this subject may progress to Latin 4."
