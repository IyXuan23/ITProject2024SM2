    "overview": [
        "This subject offers an overview of the history, geography, and culture of a range of cities across the French-speaking world. Students will be introduced to key concepts and debates in Urban Studies and Globalised City Studies and will apply them to a Francophone context. Each city will be analysed through a different lens, allowing students to reflect on how themes such as memory, migration, language, and religion have an impact on the cityscape in the Francophone world. Cities to be explored include Algiers, Fort-de-France, and Montreal.",
        "Students will examine a range of contemporary, multimedia material set in different Francophone cities, including novels, films, images, comics, and monuments. The assessment tasks will allow students to apply their theoretical knowledge of Urban Studies and Globalised City Studies as developed throughout the subject to a range of Francophone cities through written, oral, and digital assignments. The subject will be taught and assessed in French."
