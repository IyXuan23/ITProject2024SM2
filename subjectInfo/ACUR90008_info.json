    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to the various practices of curating contemporary art. The professional context for curating contemporary art has evolved from curating exhibitions and conserving collections in art museums. Now, however, contemporary art curating is practiced both within and beyond art institutions and has undergone massive global expansion. The subject will develop the skills unique to curating contemporary art by analyzing these shifts, by explaining recent theories of contemporary art curatorship, by surveying innovations and developments that have taken place in recent contemporary art curatorship including in laboratory-format public programs, as well as by defining and exploring the dedicated professional networks of freelance and emerging contemporary art curators."
