    "overview": [
        "The specification, estimation, and testing of a range of models used to analyse microeconometric data is examined. The models to be considered may include discrete choice models, models for censored and truncated data, models of duration data, models with self-selectivity, models of count data and panel data. This subject also provides students with the experience of carrying out a research-based project on a specific topic in applied econometrics."
