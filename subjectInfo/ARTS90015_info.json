    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces a range of fundamental theories of the nature of language and approaches to the analysis of its structure and use. The way we will do this is to critically examine 6 sets of readings representing current issues, debates or opposing points of view; to make explicit their theoretical backgrounds and assumptions, how this affects the course of their arguments, and what counts as \u2018evidence\u2019. Many of these sets of articles represent a conflict between \u2018emic\u2019 (abstract, \u2018insider\u2019 knowledge) and \u2018etic\u2019 (observable, measurable) approaches; an opposition which is pervasive across linguistics and applied linguistics. All materials will be made available through LMS. Students are encouraged to begin reading early."
