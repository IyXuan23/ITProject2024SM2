        "This subject introduces and develops Teacher Candidates\u2019 practical and theoretical understandings of learning in and through the arts and creative pedagogies in early childhood education. This subject references the Australian/Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks and Curricula (VEYLDF). Teacher Candidates engage with Drama, Music and Visual Arts in relation to the VEYLDF\u2019s understandings of creative skills and play-based learning.",
        "Arts-centred pedagogies will support the integral connection between the play, the arts, and creativity to engage young children in early childhood education. Indigenous perspectives are foregrounded to acknowledge and engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander contributions to the arts and arts practices in early childhood education. Teacher Candidates will participate in arts processes and reflect critically and creatively on these through a range of practices that will extend their knowledge of planning and implementing arts experiences with young children."
