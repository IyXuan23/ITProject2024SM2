        "This subject will be offered twice: one intensive for paper and painting specialties, and the other intensive for object-based specialties.  It includes individual or group projects in either the conservation laboratory at the Grimwade Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation with in the field, or off campus conservation treatments.",
        "During the pre-teaching period students are expected to participate in a 1-hour online orientation forum, engage with the online lectures, complete the course readings, quizzes and any other course preparation as outlined in the LMS.
