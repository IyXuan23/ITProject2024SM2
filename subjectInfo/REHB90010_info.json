    "overview": [
        "Research and evidence informs best practice and innovation in health care. This subject will provide graduates with an opportunity to extend their understanding of evidence based practice and research methodology, including research ethics. It will further develop skills in critical analysis of existing and emerging research that targets measurement, rehabilitation and human performance. There will be a focus on principles of evidence based practice including the techniques for critical evaluation of all aspects of published research. This will include the principles of descriptive and interferential statistics and concepts of measurement as well as critical appraisal of systematic reviews and clinical guidelines for the validity of their conclusions to contemporary health care. Synthesising key components of writing research proposals will provide a method of integrating the research writing, design and measurement aspects of this subject. On completion of this subject students will be able to apply all steps in evidence-based practice, synthesize systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines and write a research proposal relevant to practice. Further they will have developed skills in communicating research findings such as designing posters, oral presentations and written research proposals."
