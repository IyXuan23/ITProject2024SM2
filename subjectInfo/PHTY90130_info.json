    "overview": [
        "This subject will require students to integrate and apply an advanced body of knowledge, cognitive, technical and creative skills to complete a substantial research project with the guidance of a designated mentor/s. Building on their previous learning in PHTY90122 Research and Evidence, the Research Capstone provides students with research and scholarship opportunities to extend, deepen and apply knowledge, skills and attributes in the research context. Students may choose from one of three research streams, Applied Research, Teaching and Learning Research, or Health Promotion and Equity Research. Under regular mentor supervision, students will immerse in a combination of different scholarship activities, including advanced search skills, critical appraisal, project design, data collection and management, data analysis and interpretation, and knowledge dissemination relevant to the project and stream. The student will justify and present a component of a research program, service or resource, to address an identified area of need. This subject provides the opportunity for interdisciplinary networking, and dissemination of project outcomes with student peers and professional colleagues."
