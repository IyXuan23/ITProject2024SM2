    "overview": [
        "Students will acquire a theoretical understanding and knowledge required to understand the production of clinical ultrasound images, including ultrasound physics, transducer and machine componentry, image optimisation, artefacts, and probe manipulation.  This will enable safe application of focused ultrasound to improve patient clinical diagnosis and management, including the indications, contraindications, pitfalls and limitations of clinical ultrasound (both generally and in a specific (chosen) health care specialty).",
        "Students will also be able to evaluate the requirements for training, competence and certification in focused ultrasound."

        "Comprehend and demonstrate the understanding of common pitfalls and limitations of clinical ultrasound and how these impact on the clinical utility of clinical ultrasound",
        "Comprehend and demonstrate the understanding of evaluate how to optimise ultrasound images for a variety of types of clinical ultrasound",
        "Comprehend and demonstrate the understanding of requirements for focused ultrasound reporting, image archiving, infection control, and machine care",
