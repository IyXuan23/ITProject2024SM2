    "overview": [
        "This subject will cover the aerodynamics and thermodynamics of aircraft gas turbines and rockets and provide the tools to design and evaluate the performance of jet engines.It will also present the current environmental impacts of aviation and paths for more sustainable aviation.",
        "Topics include:",
        "Understanding the requirements and background of jet engines, in particular how the requirements translate to the design of an engine.",
        "An overview of the key aerodynamical aspects of aircraft relevant to the propulsion system and how jet engines create thrust.",
        "Engine performance parameters. These are discussed in the context of thermal, cycle and propulsive efficiencies.",
        "Principles and layouts of jet engines. Different classes of engines will be looked at, such as turbojets, turbofans, and bypass ratios, turbine inlet temperature will be discussed.",
        "Fundamentals of compressible flow relevant to jet engines will be discussed, including stagnation quantities and choked nozzles.",
        "Dimensional analysis and non-dimensional variables of engines.",
        "How to configure compressors and turbines, with consideration of blade profiles, flow coefficient, cooling and losses.",
        "Environmental impacts of aviation and challenges and strategies for more sustainable aviation.",
        "Rocket propulsion: what are the performance parameters and what are the benefits of staging?"
