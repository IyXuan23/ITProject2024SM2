    "overview": [
        "This subject has a focus on dance theatre skills. Building on the work of previous semesters, this subject extends the dancer\u2019s embodied, creative and technical flexibility through continued studio technical training incorporating skills in voice and use of text.",
        "More complex understanding of body awareness, kinesthetic pathways, movement coordination, breath patterns and motor learning is supported by tasking and advanced instruction that explores narrative and meaning in contemporary contexts of performance. Detailed gestural and whole body movement is integrated allowing the students to extend their capacity to metamorphose the quality and distinction of their movement. Musicality and rhythmic knowledge are deepened and collaborations with live music cultivates an attuned sensitivity to the space and tone of attention in the relationship between dancer and musician. Voice skills are developed through vocal warm-ups and the learning of sung and percussive scores.",
        "Connecting technical training with repertory work, in Dance Lab 3 students also develop skills in creative dexterity as they apply technical knowledge to the interpretation and recreation of dance scores. Students continue to apply an autonomous practice addressing specific technical and creative goals in consultation with staff, building fitness, flexible thinking, resilience, creativity, conceptual dexterity and self-confidence as performers."
