        "Learning in Australian early childhood environments requires understanding of our relational selves on Country and our diversity. This subject considers a range of theories and perspectives to explore constructions of development, diversity, inclusion and belonging in early childhood contexts, to support the development of children\u2019s strong sense of identity.",
        "This subject references the Australian/Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks and Curricula. Policies and frameworks require teachers to recognise and respond to barriers to children/young people achieving educational success. Teacher Candidates will explore ways to challenge practices that contribute to inequities and make curriculum decisions that promote inclusion and participation of all children/young people from various Aboriginal and Islander, racialised, linguistic, ethnic, cultural, LGBTQI+, gender, socio-economic, religious backgrounds. Teacher Candidates will also develop skills and knowledge to identify and implement support, intentional teaching strategies or intervention that is required to support children\u2019s learning."
