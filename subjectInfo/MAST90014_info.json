    "overview": [
        "The use of mathematical optimisation is widespread in business, where it is a key analytical tool for managing and planning business operations. It is also required in many industrial processes and is useful to government and community organizations. This subject will expose students to operations research techniques as used in industry. A heavy emphasis will be placed on the modelling process that turns an industrial problem into a mathematical formulation. The focus will then be on how to solve the resulting mathematical problem with mixed-integer programming techniques."
