    "overview": [
        "In many cultures the study of celestial phenomena has taken a central role in the attempts to understand the world they lived in. The apparent regularity of sun, moon and stars enabled observers to formulate rules for the behaviour of celestial bodies and infer various conclusions from these rules, ranging from cosmological models to astrological predictions. The subject will study how astronomical knowledge has developed throughout the world. It combines simple astronomical observations and study of historical instruments with classes discussing the development of astronomy in different cultures ranging from East Asia via the Middle East and Europe to Central America and Australia.",
        "Central questions will be: How were the same phenomena interpreted in different cultures? How were astronomical observations done? What political and religious functions did astronomy have? How was astronomical knowledge transmitted between different cultures? Why did early modern Europe become the place that developed the idea of modern science and how did other civilisations react to the astronomical developments in Europe? The subject will thus give an overview of the origins of our modern world view while offering reflections on cross-cultural studies of science."
