    "overview": [
        "This subject explores the dynamic processes which shape Earth\u2019s current and ancient landscapes through an 8-day fieldtrip in south-eastern Australia. It will form a practical introduction into mapping the Earth using a range of techniques relevant to geoscience, geography and environmental science. The fieldtrip will focus on integrating remote sensing data, satellite imagery and detailed field observations to understand and map the evolution of the natural landscape. Earth surface processes and environments will be considered from geological timescales of millions of years to those operating in today\u2019s landscape. Field exercises will explore the links between Earth history, landform evolution, soil development and the natural environment in foothills of the Great Dividing Range. Students will learn the basic methods used to gather large scale surficial and geological data including rock, fossil and mineral identification. Emphasis will be placed on the practical application of a range of disciplines including remote sensing, sedimentary processes, stratigraphy, physical volcanology, palaeontology, weathering/soil formation, geomorphology and hydrogeology. There will be a pre-trip introduction to the subject, as well as a post-trip workshop on the field report, including a remote sensing exercise."
