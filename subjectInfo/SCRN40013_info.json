    "overview": [
        "This subject examines the histories, cultural contexts and current debates surrounding censorship in the visual arts. Censorship practices and protocols will be defined and investigated in relation to issues of morality, legality and the public sphere. The changing definitions and complexities of censorship will be investigated in instances of creative freedom challenging prohibition in film, performing arts, visual art and media cultures.",
        "Students will gain a theoretical understanding of the historical and emerging debates surrounding the controversial area of censorship, freedom of speech and expression. Students will also study censorship in national and international contexts with an emphasis on specific case studies. This subject will also examine how artistic practice influences wider cultural, political and legal prohibitions underlying film, the arts and media."
