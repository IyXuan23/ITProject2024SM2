        "This subject applies performance methodologies and generative strategies to the creation of new work in theatre-making. Students will devise work in response to extant stories, texts and other stimuli, adapting and modifying theatrical forms and styles, including the grotesque and tragedy, to create original pieces of work.",
        "The subject culminates in the creation of a contemporary tragedy, an ensemble devised work, directed by a guest director and presented in a public studio season. As emerging theatre makers, students will evaluate both processes and outcomes through ongoing reflection and begin to articulate elements of their performance and devising methodology.",
        "In applying technical skills to creative exercises, students will develop their performance and devising skills and develop skills in reflective practice."
