    "overview": [
        "This subject challenges students to consider how is architecture situated \u2013 environmentally, politically and socially and culturally \u2013 and in turn how a site can influence architectural design.",
        "A variety of independent studios will be offered for preferencing by ballot prior to the start of semester (O-week). Programmes will vary and may include civic, urban, housing, institutional, community or commercial typologies. Common to all studios will be sites that have cultural, environmental, political and legal complexities which designs will need to address. Seminar series, workshops and/or online modules will introduce students to design theories, design techniques and digital tools related to the design challenge(s), as a creative and intellectual counterpoint to design-led exploration in-studio.",
        "Through a process of careful socio-cultural and environmental analysis of a complex site, study of precedents, and application of contemporary design theories and techniques, students will be expected to develop architectural designs that respond to their site with sensitivity and care. Students will be expected to demonstrate the cultural and site-based competencies set out in the National Standards of Competency for Architects. Students will also be asked to develop a style of design communication that is culturally appropriate to their \u2018client\u2019/stakeholder.",

        "Please note  : This is an \u2018early start subject\u2019 (for SEM 1 and 2)  a ballot for preferencing studios runs on Monday of O-week \u2013 the week BEFORE week 1 on the university calendar ( - and a compulsory all-day in-person symposium is on the Friday of O-week."
