    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce a range of specialised and emerging research techniques and technologies and apply them to understanding contemporary research problems relating to infection and immunity. The principles and scientific basis underpinning methods to study (i) the expression and regulation of host and/or pathogen genes/proteins and (ii) techniques to visualise these factors will be explained. The application of these techniques to current cutting-edge science and technology will be analysed and explored. This subject will be taught by scientists who are research leaders in the discipline using relevant pathogen and disease-specific case examples. Students will engage with the content of this subject through a series of online pre-recorded lectures, live seminars and workshops, and laboratory based practical classes."
