    "overview": [
        "Having recently passed the 30th anniversary of the landmark Australian medical law decisionRogers v Whitakerin 2022, medical litigation remains a vibrant and challenging field given the rapid pace of scientific and social developments that generate new challenges for the law. Many developments are at the core of individual importance - birth, reproduction and personal autonomy. The legal issues are wide-ranging, covering the existence of duties, what should be considered to be a breach of duty, the challenges of legal causation and the determination of appropriate compensation- all against a background of insurance affordability, medical treatment innovations and dispute resolution process changes.",
