    "overview": [
        "The subject introduces students to the molecular and cellular aspects of biological systems, with particular emphasis on human biology. The subject is arranged for students to develop an understanding of the molecular aspects of biology at the biomolecular, sub-cellular and cellular level, leading to systems biology at an organismal level. This includes an understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of infections and host cell responses. The subject is multi-disciplinary being co-taught by staff in the departments of Anatomy & Neuroscience, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology & immunology, and Pathology. There is particular emphasis on integration of these disciplines, with students receiving both theoretical and practical knowledge of fundamental research and development at the frontiers of these areas.",
