    "overview": [
        "This subject is suitable for graduate students seeking to understand the donor or sovereign government driven international development sector of international development and humanitarian work and the considerations and challenges in delivering culturally appropriate sustainable infrastructure outcomes.  This subject complements the theory and principles in ABPL90277 Humanitarian Construction and further explores the policy settings, political motivations, contextual and cultural considerations of this specific area of the international development sector.",
        "Through in-person class sessions, students will gain an appreciation of current theory, practices and approaches and undertake a series of group activities related to the delivery of infrastructure investment in this part of the international development sector. The subject has been designed to enable students to apply their technical discipline understanding and learnings from prior studies and work experience and to collaborate with interdisciplinary peers. Industry leaders, guest presenters and technical experts will share their experiences and project case studies for students to learn about the industry and to test and challenge their own personal values and perspectives when working in developing countries.",
        "The subject will offer built environment and other graduate students an insight into the principles, strategic objectives and priority areas of delivering quality infrastructure to build genuine and respectful partnerships with our international neighbours in the Asia Pacific region. Topics will include how to prepare, plan, program, design and construct sustainable infrastructure in differing cultural contexts as well as how to consider policy, governance, economic, environmental and social factors in order to sensitively manage and implement complex program requirements linked to specific outcomes in a development context. Finally, students will also develop an understanding of potential pathways and employment opportunities in the international development industry."
