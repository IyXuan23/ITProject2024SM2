    "overview": [
        "Topics will include the core elements of supply chain analysis, beginning with models for analysing purchasing, procurement and supplier evaluation. Inventory management will be treated as a core element of supply chain management, lending itself to useful models. Modelling of logistics and transport networks will be covered, with the aim normally being to achieve lowest cost solutions while at specified service levels. Additional topics to be covered are models of sustainability in supply chains and risk management within supply contexts. Case studies will be used to apply all these topics in practical settings."
