    "overview": [
        "This subject is for students across the university interested in understanding and appreciating theatre, an ancient art form that enjoys continuing popularity in many modern societies, including Australia. Drawing on a range of local and international examples from mainstream and experimental performance styles, we examine what is distinctive about the theatre experience, and what it can tell us about the place and times we live in.",
        "Students new to theatre should gain some insight into why it remains such a vital art form, as well as a firm grounding in theatre appreciation that will serve them well long after the subject is over. More experienced theatre-goers will find the subject\u2019s approach to the fundamentals of the form a refreshing and provocative basis for deeper understanding and further study. In order to achieve these goals, the subject is divided into three parts. Part One identifies theatre\u2019s unique qualities. Part Two explores how to analyse them. Part Three considers theatre in society. Seminar discussions will draw on plays, critical writings and performance recordings, while also making the most of Melbourne\u2019s own vibrant theatre scene."
