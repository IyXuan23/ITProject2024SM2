        "Alexander the Great was arguably one of the most important historical figures in Western History. He created one of the largest empires known and contributed to the spread of ancient Greek culture to areas far beyond the Classical Greek World, including today\u2019s Iran, India and Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Turkey and the Balkans. His legacy went down in history as one of the most influential examples of masculinity and male virtue, including Hebrew, Arab and Medieval literature, as well as contemporary film and music.",
        "In this subject, we examine the foundations of the Ancient Greek World that led to the rise of the small kingdom of Macedon in the Classical period (fifth-fourth centuries BCE). Students learn about the innovations to political government and religion in this period and study representative examples of art, archaeology and literature from the Age of Alexander the Great."
