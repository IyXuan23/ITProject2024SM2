        "Supervised field education provides a focused practice learning experience. Students will deepen their practice experience in areas including the integration of social work theory, knowledge, values, and practice, further develop practice skills, increase their knowledge of the interface between policy, research and evidence-based practice and increase their understanding of the organisational contexts and fields of practice. The second placement is comprised of two subjects taken consecutively: SCWK90050 Supervised Field Placement 2A and SCWK90051 Supervised Field Placement 2B. This subject constitutes the first half (250 hours) of the second supervised field placement required within the Master of Social Work course."
