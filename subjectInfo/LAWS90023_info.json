    "overview": [
        "This subject will examine the ways in which geopolitical concepts and arguments relate to various fields of international law, and the way in which they are given expression in legal doctrines, principles and practice.  Together we will explore the way in which geopolitical contests, such as those associated with the Cold War, have led to the formation of \u2018international frontiers\u2019 in both geographical and disciplinary terms.  We will explore examples of these contests, and examine their effects on international legal doctrines (such as the use of force, intervention, sovereignty and statehood), and on the formation of new legal regimes (such as the deep sea bed, and the law of outer space).",
