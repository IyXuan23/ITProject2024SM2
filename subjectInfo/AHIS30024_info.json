    "overview": [
        "This course will explore the creation, use, and theories of \u201cvirtual spaces\u201d\u2014 constructed environments and multimedia artworks that combine architecture, gardens, painting, and sculpture to transport viewers into different spatial and temporal universes\u2014in Japanese visual culture.",
        "Through weekly case studies of temples, shrines, gardens, castles, mausoleums, brothels, theatres, museums, and world\u2019s fairs, as well as authentic experiential learning and work integrated learning (WIP), students will gain an understanding of key monuments in Japanese art from the 6th to 20th centuries as well as the manner by which these monuments functioned as greater than the sum of their parts. The techniques and means by which visual arts were employed to overwhelm the senses, transport viewers into supernatural worlds, consolidate political power, placate the dead, and define Japan as a nation and culture itself will be considered."
