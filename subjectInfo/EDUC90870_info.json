        "This subject provides a foundation enabling Doctor of Education candidates to focus and start building their own doctoral research studies. It covers key conceptual and practical issues associated with the planning and organisation of a comprehensive doctoral research study. In consultation with their supervisors, and starting from their own initial research proposals, Doctor of Education candidates will work toward developing a better understanding of the framing, focus and scope adequate for their own research studies. This will be achieved through them identifying and justifying a) the core research problem and question(s) framing their own research studies, and b) the broader approach that would be appropriate for addressing the question(s) at hand."
