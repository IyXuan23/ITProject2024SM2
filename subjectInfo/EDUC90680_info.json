    "overview": [
        "This subject will examine the productive aspects of language and literacy through the composition of written, audio, visual, and multimodal texts, in spoken, print and/or digital forms. Intersections between theory and creating texts in practice will be explored. Participants will build the professional knowledge and skills required to teach students how to coherently express and develop ideas and communicate information for different purposes, through considered and deliberate choices about text structure and organisation, across a diverse range of text types, and modes. Participants will also reflect on and develop an understanding of themselves as writers/text creators; and of the role of teacher as writer in developing students as writers. Topics include: theory for teaching writing/text composition; writing and creating texts in the current Victorian/Australian Curriculum; social semiotics and designing meaning in different and multiple modes; composing multimodal print and digital texts; pedagogical models for teaching text composition; creativity and imagination in designing meaning; generating ideas; knowledge of function and form to enable students to creatively and purposefully shape meaning; teachers as writers/text composers; assessing student produced texts."
