        "The contemporary political, economic, technological and social environment is undergoing rapid and transformational change. This is a period of massive disruption as we harness technological innovations and transform the ways in which wealth is created in the new digital economy. Our organisations need to respond to this change and develop strategies and structures to support the reformation of business and work practices necessary to survive.",
        "This subject focuses on the strategic response required by organisations to address this disruption. The subject further explores development and implementation of information systems as both a catalyst for, and a response to, organisational change.",
        "In this subject, several change management theories and models are investigated in depth with an analysis of their applicability, benefits, risks and impacts. A case study of a contemporary organisation is used to facilitate this learning with the application of theory, methods and best practices applied in real situations. These learnings will be of enormous value to students and professionals leading the change in their organisations.",

It promotes innovative thinking around the deployment of existing and emerging information technologies. The subject contributes to the development of independent critical inquiry, analysis and reflection."
