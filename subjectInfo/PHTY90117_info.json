    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to develop within the student a clear sense of professional identity and professional standards, the values of collaboration, respect and humility and the importance of their own mental health and well-being throughout their lifelong learning journey. Students will have the opportunity to learn the foundational knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to becoming a physiotherapist. The focus of the subject will be on preparing students to work with patients in a variety of contexts including as first contact practitioners and as practitioners working within health care teams. The subject will emphasise topics such as professional identity formation, ethical decision making, evidence-based practice, clinical reasoning, collaborative practice, health behaviour change, exercise and physical activity prescription and effective communication. The development of professional knowledge and skills that underpin assessment, diagnosis, education and patient engagement in physiotherapy practice are fundament to this subject as are the fundamental research skills required to practice evidence-based practice. Students learn the core strands of physiotherapy knowledge and practice and how to integrate practice with the health needs of individuals, communities and populations, including how these apply to chronic illness."
