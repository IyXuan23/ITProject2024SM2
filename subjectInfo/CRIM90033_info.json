        "A key issue for criminal justice is the challenge of responding to offenders with specialised needs arising from mental disorders, health problems, physical disability, and age. This subject examines the different approaches taken by criminal justice agencies in Australia and Japan in relation to the identification and assessment of such offenders are identified and assessed, available pathways through the justice system, and the programs and institutional settings that have been developed in response to their needs. The subject will be taught in Japan and will include sessions by Australian and Japanese academics or practitioners, with a planned visit to a Japanese criminal justice institution. Please note: Prior to travelling overseas, students are required to attend a half-day of preparatory seminars designed to introduce them to key facets of the Japanese criminal justice system (on-campus). Students must also attend a concluding review session on-campus upon return from Japan."
