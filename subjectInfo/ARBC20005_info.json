    "overview": [
        "Students in this subject start developing in-depth knowledge of the Arab World in general, as well as of individual countries in the region. This will include approaching the Middle East and North Africa from a historic perspective which is crucial to the critical understanding of its civilisation and to appreciating existing customs, lifestyle and prevailing values. Students will also enjoy reading and/or hearing information about, and texts by, extraordinary Arab writers, poets and singers giving expression to ideas, feelings and aspirations born in the Arab World. In this, students will be aided by the increasingly complex linguistic elements learnt in this course which will make it possible to enjoy the writings on the history of the Arab World, biographies, poems, reflective essays, informative reports and newspaper and magazine articles offered during this semester.",
        "Students will have the opportunity to convey their own views and opinions and to relate their own experiences in personal accounts and essays, and to present the results of their own small-scale research, conducted using library and web-based materials, in the form of oral presentations."
