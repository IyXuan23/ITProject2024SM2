        "Fluid flow and its applications are widespread in nature and everyday life. The scientific investigation of these naturally occurring air and water flows, especially those affecting the environmental quality is known as Environmental Fluid Mechanics. Given the fast-paced changes in our environment and their societal impacts, it has become imperative for engineering students to have a comprehensive understanding of environmental fluid mechanics. This subject is aimed at shedding light on a variety of environmental systems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, lakes, streams, and building ventilation. As such, it has been crafted with the intention of being both engaging and relevant for students specializing in Physics, Engineering, or the physical aspects of marine or climate science."

    "indicative content": [
        "This subject focuses on the fluid dynamics of various processes, which can span from the minute turbulent eddies at the millimetre scale to the large-scale dispersion of pollutants, contaminating a region extending over several kilometres. The prime components of the flows addressed in this course are buoyancy effects and fluid motions resulting from density differences. These differences in density may arise from variations in temperature, solute concentration, composition, or due to the occurrence of phase change.",
        "The subject kicks off with a comprehensive overview of the fluid mechanics field and an explanation of the physics dictating fluid flow. These physical principles are then applied to numerous examples, encompassing free-surface flows, gravity currents, stratified flows, gravity waves, convection and heat transfer, and rotational effects.",
        "The course is structured into five modules.Module 1provides a grounding in the Basic Laws of Fluid Mechanics.Module 2delves into Surface Waves in fluid.Module 3investigates Free Surface and two-layer flows, whileModule 4explores Stratification and Convection. Finally,Module 5examines the Rotational effects on fluid dynamics. In parallel, the students will utilise an environmental flow software to carry out a project that forms the major assessment"
