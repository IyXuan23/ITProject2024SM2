    "overview": [
        "This subject will support Interns to make decisions about responding to students\u2019 learning needs using evidence-informed approaches. Interns will explore the science of learning and its relationship to effective, culturally informed teaching and learning strategies. To support students\u2019 participation, Interns will identify and respond to behaviours of concern and the contexts in which they emerge. Interns will understand the historical and contextual factors in which language and communication are embedded and develop strategies to support the language and communication needs of students. The processes that underpin the successful development of literacy and numeracy will be explored, including identifying the literacy and numeracy needs of students and how to intervene using students\u2019 strengths and capabilities. The Clinical Teaching Model will be used to assess, plan and develop interventions for students with disability and diverse learning needs. Interns will examine the importance of parent/carer involvement in education and how to work effectively with colleagues, other professionals and the community. This subject will also support Interns\u2019 explorations of classroom communication and management practices and strategies that support students\u2019 wellbeing and safety to provide high-quality inclusive learning environments that meet school and/or system, curriculum and legislative requirements. It will equip Interns to build on fundamental skills necessary to observe, design and implement teaching strategies to engage all students. This subject references the relevant Australian educational frameworks and curricula.",
        "This subject includes a Clinical Teaching Practicum (employment-based teaching appointment) in a Secondary school over Terms 1 and 2 (four days per week). Interns will demonstrate the nexus between theory and the practice of teaching through the use of the Clinical Teaching Model, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research to support their teaching practice. Interns are supported by experienced Clinical Specialists and Mentor Teachers. A series of seminars will be held which explore Interns\u2019 developing professional knowledge, practice and engagement. In this subject Interns will also complete the Assessment for Graduate Teaching (AfGT)."
