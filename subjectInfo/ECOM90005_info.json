    "overview": [
        "This course is designed to introduce you to the mathematical underpinnings of the main tools used in empirical economics. Special emphasis will be given to three topics: models of probability, methods of estimation, and methods of inference. Simple mathematical analysis, in particular both differential and integral calculus as well as linear algebra, will be used extensively throughout the course. In an effort to bridge the gap between analytic, closed-form methods and numerical methods, you will also be introduced to a high-level matrix and programming language, Matlab, to provide you with a basis to solve problems which have no closed-form solutions."
