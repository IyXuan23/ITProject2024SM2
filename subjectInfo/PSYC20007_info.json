        "Mental processes such as attention, memory, language and categorisation form the basis of our creative human cognitive abilities. An understanding of these cognitive abilities and the methods used by cognitive psychologists to study them provides an essential foundation for ongoing study in psychology. Classic and current research findings will be discussed to reveal what is known about the workings of the human mind.",
        "Specific topics may include: Perceptual processes and their role in cognition; the nature and function of selective attention; categorization, similarity and the mental representation of knowledge; the structure, function and organisation of the human memory system; human learning and decision making.",
        "A quantitative methods component will be integrated into the lecture, tutorial and assessment structure of this subject to provide an understanding of and practical experience with the experimental design and statistical analysis techniques used to evaluate theories in cognitive psychology."
