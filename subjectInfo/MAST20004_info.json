    "overview": [
        "This subject offers a thorough grounding in the basic concepts of mathematical probability and probabilistic modelling. Topics covered include random experiments and sample spaces, probability axioms and theorems, discrete and continuous random variables/distributions (including measures of location, spread and shape), expectations and generating functions, independence of random variables and measures of dependence (covariance and correlation), methods for deriving the distributions of transformations of random variables or approximations for them (including the central limit theorem).",
        "The probability distributions and models discussed in the subject arise frequently in real world applications. These include a number of widely used one- and two-dimensional (particularly the bivariate normal) distributions and also fundamental probability models such as Poisson processes and Markov chains."
