    "overview": [
        "Contemporary business is awash in data. Modern business processes and activities usually involve multiple streams of data from areas as diverse as marketing activities, operational processes and financial activities. Therefore, managers are frequently confronted with how to harness these to understand their business better, so that they can make more informed decisions. This subject provides the fundamental quantitative skills necessary for an MBA student to extract information from data, through quantitative analysis, to make better managerial decisions. Students will be familiarized with the tools of quantitative analysis, develop the necessary skills for analytical thinking and a quantitative mind set in measuring performance. The fundamental quantitative skills from this subject provide a foundation to the advanced subjects within the MBA and provide students an analytical framework towards solving managerial problems later in their career."
