    "overview": [
        "This Criminology capstone subject invites students to engage critically and creatively with the question: What is criminology? Students will develop a criminological research project that responds to a significant social justice problem or criminal justice scenario, to think through the consequences and implications for human lives and communities. Ideas and possibilities \u2013 both \u2018real world\u2019 problems and hypothetical situations \u2013 are presented as a starting point.",
        "Students then have opportunities to shape the focus of their project-based work: either applying disciplinary skills and theoretical approaches to a topic or scenario; or developing a more policy or practice-focused response to an issue or problem identified through consultation with industry or community partners. Either pathway provides the opportunity for students to synthesise, extend and apply the disciplinary knowledge gained through the Criminology major. Towards the end of the subject students are invited to reflect on what it means to be a criminologist, and to take stock of the disciplinary skills and knowledge they have gained across the major."
