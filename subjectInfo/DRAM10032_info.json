    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces key contemporary and historical theatre practitioners and their practices, juxtaposing clustered themes such as ritual, text, time, space, and body. At the same time, students will consider their own values and beliefs to contextualise their position as an emerging artist.",
        "Towards this, the subject will teach the student how to examine performance practice through description, interpretation and analysis, helping students to understand different modes of critical engagement. Students will be able to analyse past and present paradigms of theatre arts practices, the unique responses to the world and the value-systems which drive artistic development including their own emerging artistry.",
        "This subject is co-delivered to Bachelor of Fine Arts (Acting) and Bachelor of Fine Arts (Theatre) students."
