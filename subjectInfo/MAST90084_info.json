        "Statistical models are central to applications of statistics and their development motivates new statistical theories and methodologies. Commencing with a review of linear and generalized linear models, analysis of variance and experimental design, the theory of linear mixed models is developed and model selection techniques are introduced. Approaches to non and semiparametric inference, including generalized additive models, are considered. Specific applications may include longitudinal data, survival analysis and time series modelling."
