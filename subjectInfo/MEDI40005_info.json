    "overview": [
        "This subject aims to provide opportunities for students to gain an understanding in, and extend the practice of translational biomedical research, and to understand the importance of research translation from the bench to the clinic leads to improved clinical management of human health and disease.",
        "Students will undertake an original research project in a basic, translational or clinical science in laboratories based in the Eastern Hill Academic Centre (from the Dept. of Medicine or Surgery, St Vincents Hospital) or in one of our affiliated research institutes (St Vincents Institute of Medical Research (including O\u2019Brien Institute), Centre for Eye Research Australia and the Bionic Institute).",
        "Students undergo extensive research training with their own individually-supervised research project, acquiring skills in experimental design, technical expertise in state of the art basic, clinical and translational research methodologies, critical thinking, analysis, project management and communication. Being part of a clinical hospital site, students also have the opportunity to learn about the broader significance of research translation as it relates to human health and disease and how research can change and improve the clinical management of patients. All of the projects offer the opportunity of progression on to higher degrees including a PhD."
