        "As well as being beautiful in its own right, algebra is used in many areas of mathematics, computer science and physics. This subject provides a grounding in several fundamental areas of modern advanced algebra including Lie groups, combinatorial group theory, category theory and homological algebra.The material complements that covered in the subject Commutative and Mutlilinear Algebra without assuming it as prerequisite."
