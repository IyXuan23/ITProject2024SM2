    "overview": [
        "The subject builds on the skills base established in CHEM20020 Structure and Properties. The concepts of quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, molecular interactions and reaction kinetics will lay the fundamentals for the discussion of chemical reactions involving various types of reactive intermediates. The application of molecular orbital theory will be used to understand the nature of pericyclic reactions and the concept of coordination in main group (including carbon) and transition metal elements. An investigation of inorganic reaction mechanisms will focus on transformations involving coordination and organometallic complexes of d-block metals. Discussion of synthetic aspects will cover methods for carbon-carbon bond formation and functional group transformations, as well as principles of catalysis involving transition metal complexes and their chemistry in synthetic and biological systems."
