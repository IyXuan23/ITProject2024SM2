    "overview": [
        "Too often government and social and criminal justice policy focuses on the symptoms rather than the causes of ongoing injustice in society. This subject partners with community and government agencies to create effective change. In this industry project subject, community and government agencies come in and discuss areas of their work that would benefit from criminological research. We then work with you on developing a project, doing research, preparing a response and presenting this to the agency in conversation with them. Past agency partners have included the Human Rights Law Centre, Fitzroy Legal Service, WEstjustice, Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, Consumer Action Law Centre and Victoria Police (Priority Communities). This subject also introduces you to the concepts of structural injustice and structural justice that help us to better recognise and address underlying causes of harm and disadvantage. It explores best practice in community-engaged research and the translation of research into policy and practice. Community Justice Project gives you the opportunity to use the conceptual frameworks and research skills developed through your Criminology and social science studies degree to create practical outcomes in crime and justice."
