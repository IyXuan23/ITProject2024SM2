        "This subject requires students to undertake a project within an Aboriginal community on a topic selected by the student in consultation with the community. The subject critically examines key principles and processes involved in conducting community projects, and considers the philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of such work. Particular emphasis is placed on understanding the role and nature of community engagement and participation, application of the project, specifically in rural contexts, and potential outcomes for and empowerment of the specific community. In undertaking this subject, students will gain community development and project management skills and be introduced to a range of orthodox and alternative methodologies."
