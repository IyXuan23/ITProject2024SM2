    "overview": [
        "This subject deals with structural geology, large scale tectonic processes and methods for extracting geological information from geophysical datasets. In the structural geology and tectonics component, students explore advanced aspects of tectonics to link deformation processes and features across a range of scales, including via field work. The subject will begin with a one-week pre-semester field trip to East Gippsland, where students will develop their geological mapping, regional geology and structural analysis skills. This field trip will also include intensive style teaching with a parallel lecture and practical program held on-site. In the geophysics component, students explore potential fields, focusing on the gravity and magnetic methods and how they can be used to understand geology. Students work with industry standard software (e.g. Geosoft - Oasis Montaj) which performs the maths in the background. Topics include: maps, projection systems, datums and GPS; theory, acquisition, processing and interpretation steps involved for gravity and magnetic methods; image enhancement and qualitative interpretation techniques.",
        "The field trip will take place in the weeks immediately prior to the normal commencement of classes for Semester 1. The estimated cost of the field trip is $380 but this may vary slightly at time of field trip."
