        "This subject considers the porous boundaries between popular and elite cultures in the French-speaking world. By exploring and critically analysing different genres and mediums, students will gain a greater insight on how art communicates ideas. This subject aims to further students' advanced level of proficiency in all aspects of French language acquisition, and to bring students to Level C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).",
        "Three distinct components will inform the learning experience and give students the opportunity to examine a range of innovative and creative presentation formats. Through the combination of theory and practice, students will explore graphic fiction and non-fiction, art collections and contemporary music, hence deepening their understanding of art and its relevance in past and present francophone societies."
