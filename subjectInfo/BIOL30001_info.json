        "This subject aims to give students of science and biomedical science a solid foundation in human and animal reproductive biology and its applications. Students will be provided with a curriculum informed by current research and addressing an understanding of the principles and processes of reproductive biology, the biological bases of reproductive disorders and diseases, assisted reproductive technologies and reproduction in a global context. Students will gain experience in learning how to search the primary scientific literature.",
        "Topics will include structure, function, and development of the reproductive organs; endocrine and neuroendocrine and environmental control of reproduction, fertilisation, pregnancy, parturition and lactation in humans and other animals; reproductive diseases and disorders; assisted reproductive technologies; and reproduction in a community and global perspective.",
