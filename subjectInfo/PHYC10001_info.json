        "This subject is designed for students with a strong interest and background in physics, and aims to provide a deep understanding of a broad range of physics principles and applications. Topics include:Mechanics: describing and explaining translational and rotational motion, for example in the contexts of human and animal movement and transport (Newton\u2019s laws of motion, both translational and rotational; energy transfer and transformation; momentum and impulse; simple harmonic motion, equilibrium).Waves and sound: water waves; seismic waves; production and detection of sound, eg. musical instruments, hearing; ultrasound (reflection and refraction, superposition, resonance, energy transport, absorption, Doppler effect).Optics: optical imaging, sensors and optical instruments, human vision, crystallography (dispersion, lenses and mirrors, interference, diffraction, polarisation).Gravitation: weightlessness, planetary and satellite orbits, escape velocity (universal gravity, Kepler\u2019s laws).Special relativity: particle accelerators, the \u2018twin paradox\u2019 (Einstein\u2019s modification of Newtonian physics, relativity of time and space, equivalence of mass and energy).Vector notation, and differential and integral calculus, are used wherever appropriate."
