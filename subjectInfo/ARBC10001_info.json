    "overview": [
        "Students will be introduced to more complex elements and functions of the language which will enable them to read and engage with authentic texts of moderate complexity ranging from advertisements, personal and formal letters and emails through newspaper articles and informative texts to biographies, which will allow them not only to internalise vocabulary and structures but also to gain a better understanding of the historical, intellectual and spiritual currents informing present-day Arab society and culture.",
        "The various audio-visual activities, accessed through the course DVDs, the LMS program and the Internet, will further develop students\u2019 listening comprehension and help maintain and augment existing knowledge of vocabulary and structures. Knowledge gained through developing reading and listening skills will be conducive to activating vocabulary and structures, and students will be able to see their progress through the varied writing and speaking activities offering plenty of opportunities for communication."
