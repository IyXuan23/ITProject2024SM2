    "overview": [
        "In this subject, students will explore Australian animal production industries, for both food (eg meat, milk & eggs) and fibre (wool) production in both extensively and intensively managed systems. Production systems discussed will include beef cattle and sheep, dairy cattle, pigs and poultry. Issues considered will include inputs and outputs of the system, on-farm husbandry and management, and the chain of production from on-farm to consumer."
