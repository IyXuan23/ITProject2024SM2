        "This subject will provide a pathway for students to gain familiarity with key issues and debates in the field of marketing communications. Students will develop a critical understanding of concepts and approaches relating to media institutions, texts and audiences. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the complex transformation from the paradigm of broadcast media to contemporary networked digital communications. This new environment of active audience participation and distributed communication has challenged the conceptual underpinnings of a range of practices including advertising, public relations, stakeholder management and marketing campaigns. Students will be introduced to the tasks of identifying and evaluating a variety of marketing strategies, and will have the opportunity to learn, examine and apply strategic marketing decision-making processes in the marketing and communications business environment."
