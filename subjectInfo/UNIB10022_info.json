    "overview": [
        "The purpose of this subject is to study topics on entrepreneurship and innovation. The subject closely examines the definition of an entrepreneur as an innovator who recognises and seizes opportunities; converts those opportunities into workable/marketable ideas; adds value through effort, money and skills; assumes the risk of the competitive marketplace to implement these ideas; and realises the rewards from these efforts.",
        "This subject presents some of the key frameworks and tools needed by entrepreneurs and is for anyone who has an interest in understanding entrepreneurship, not just potential founders. The subject uses the lens of entrepreneurship to investigate developing areas of knowledge that are relevant to all organisations, from traditional firms to startups, while also recognising that in the future, many students will either start or work for non-traditional organisations."
