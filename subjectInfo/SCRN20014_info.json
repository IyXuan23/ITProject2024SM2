    "overview": [
        "This subject re-thinks the enduring notion of authorship and its central place in the production and reception of films and other screen media. Through a detailed examination of films and filmmakers operating in global art cinema and Hollywood, students will encounter critical ideas about authorship and artistry beyond persisting misconceptions of filmmaking as the exclusive creative province of male auteurs and multi-national business conglomerates. This subject demonstrates the notion of ensemble authorship which takes into account the significant collaborating role of producers, writers, designers, technicians, actors, studios, critics, audiences and their relationships to other visual and performing arts. This subject\u2019s focus on ensemble filmmaking critically asserts the historical and contemporary significance of female filmmakers in the re-evaluation of this tenacious industrial and critical paradigm."
