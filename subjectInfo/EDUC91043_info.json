    "overview": [
        "Supporting an integrative, inter-disciplinary approach to wellbeing, this subject explores systems informed approaches to positive development and functioning, moving discourse, theory, research, and practice beyond the individual to include broader human social systems. Through experiential learning opportunities, students will unpack the philosophical and methodological assumptions that drive the positive psychology and wellbeing science fields and consider practical implications of a systems-informed perspective.",
        "Students will be introduced to a variety of systems-awareness tools, considering their practical utility in different contexts and across different situations. Students will identify the dynamic impact of factors such as culture, communities, and politics, on individual and collective wellbeing. Students will also explore systems-based approaches to sustainable change, which address the complexity of individual and collective behaviour change."
