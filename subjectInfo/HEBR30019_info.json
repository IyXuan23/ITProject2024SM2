        "Following the aims and objectives of Hebrew 9, this subject focuses on advanced accuracy, fluency and complexity in oral and written Hebrew and builds on the skills acquired in previous subjects. Through close readings in a variety of genres, students further delve into the techniques of how to structure and present more developed, scholarly essays, involving an extensive use of the formal structures of modern Hebrew in a gamut of syntaxial forms. Students are also encouraged to evolve and expand a refined utilisation of idiomatic and conversational modalities through individual and group presentations, as well as to develop a more confident command of the language."
