    "overview": [
        "Biosystems Design involves undertaking design group projects from concept to implementation in a team-based project. The emphasis of each of the projects is associated with a well-defined project description. The subject is taught in a flipped classroom format and comprises, pre-tutorial reading, discussion forums requiring student participation, guided workshops on using biosensors and transducers and self-paced project work performed in teams. Biosystems Design will help students consider the nature of team diversity when working in health and medical technology design and development. The open-ended nature of the self-paced project work in this subject will expose students to requirements for design and development of medical devices including ethics, safety and risk assessment, common sensors to detect medically relevant biomedical signals, and acquisition, amplification and processing of biomedical sensor signals. The subject will provide an integrated capstone experience in the Bioengineering Systems major.",
