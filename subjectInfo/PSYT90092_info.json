    "overview": [
        "In this subject the implications of mental health and ageing are explored from a range of perspectives. Lectures will place mental health and ageing within a lifespan framework with an emphasis on both cognitive changes in later life and consideration of other challenges to mental health as people age, including inequality and marginalisation. The subject will also focus on issues such as the high rates of suicide among older men, the impact of loneliness and social isolation on mental health, and human rights, particularly supported decision making. Integrated and multidisciplinary approaches, and community and population based strategies, to prevent and respond to age related cognitive decline and other common mental health problems in older people will be introduced.  This subject also will consider strategies to support an ageing worldwide population, including mental health promotion."
