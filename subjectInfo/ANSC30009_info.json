    "overview": [
        "Effective management of animal systems requires an appreciation of the context in which that management is carried out. This context may be predominantly social, environmental or commercial or combinations thereof. The application of scientific knowledge in conjunction with an appreciation of context, individual- or societal-goals is the domain of systems analysis and thinking. This subject aims to develop the skills required to analyse these interactions and support decision-making in animal enterprises. Students will examine real world situations, and align the scientific with the social. Assessment work will see students required to clearly identify problems to be solved, analyse options for solving the problems and then provide evidence based assessment to support their decisions. It is designed to enable students to work effectively with the owners and managers of animal businesses in bringing about change in their system."
