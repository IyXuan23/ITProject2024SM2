        "Research skills are paramount in the increasingly specialised world we live in. This subject provides you with an opportunity to conduct research on a topic of your choice, pertaining to construction. You will be focusing on the middle to final stages of research: from research design to interpreting research results and presenting them in writing, graphically and orally. The subject uses seminars with all students to share knowledge and advancement but mostly capitalises on one-on-one mentoring and supervision from dedicated supervisors to progress your research. You will use and build upon knowledge and materials acquired and developed in Research in Construction (ABPL90358) to inform your final research thesis."
