    "overview": [
        "Native forests are globally important natural resources. Their conservation and management is critical to local and regional populations for the biodiversity that they harbour and the ecosystem services that they provide. This subject will explore the conservation and management of native forests around the world.",
        "We will cover the principles of forest dynamics and sustainable forest management for a range of objectives, including wildlife habitat, water yield, carbon sequestration, and timber production. The subject will integrate ecological, environmental, economic, and social perspectives on the conservation and management of native forests through lectures, forest modeling exercises, and a week-long field trip to the Central Highlands of Victoria."
