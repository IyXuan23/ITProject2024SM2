    "overview": [
        "Using an integrated and inter-disciplinary approach, this subject examines the structure, function and potential for dysfunction of the respiratory system of the major domestic animal species. As students develop an understanding of the mechanisms of disease of this system, they will develop skills in the clinical evaluation of it and in the interpretation of relevant diagnostic procedures. Students will integrate aspects of anatomy, clinical skills and imaging to enable understanding and implementation of the diagnostic process and treatment procedures."

        "Compare and contrast the structure and function of the respiratory systems of different species",
        "Identify normal and abnormal respiratory structures in animals on gross observation, in diagnostic images, and in histological and cytological preparations",
        "Conduct a clinical examination of the respiratory system in order to assess structure and function",
        "Explain how components of the respiratory system interact to allow survival under various physiological and pathological conditions, and how they can be modified with pharmacological agents",
        "Combine regional and systemic anatomical knowledge with clinical skills in order to apply these to diagnostic, surgical and therapeutic procedures in animals",
        "Communicate orally and effectively complex scientific information to a diverse audience",
        "Work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and apply an understanding of respiratory structure and function in order to analyse and interpret clinical problems related to this system in animals"
