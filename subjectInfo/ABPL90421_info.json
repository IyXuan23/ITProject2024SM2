    "overview": [
        "This subject explores an array of philosophical perspectives on design and architecture to enable students to develop a deeper appreciation of pressing contemporary concerns where these impact on creative design practice and on the role of design understood as a world shaping activity.",
        "Theories and concepts predominantly drawn from the work of 20thand 21stCentury philosophers and theorists will be critically discussed and subsequently applied to contemporary problems relevant to the design disciplines. The course will emphasise the impact of the design disciplines on environmental, material and social concerns including a consideration of gender diversity and intersectionality. Questions concerning the interrelation of design, architecture and philosophy as different ways of thinking and fashioning environments and subjectivities will be raised: What are the ways in which humans are designed by their designs? What might the design disciplines learn from the posthumanities? What could design be, or what might it become, to make the world more hospitable for both human and more-than-human entities?"
