    "overview": [
        "This subject examines contemporary research in language acquisition and the links between language, learning, literacy and behaviour. Frameworks are provided for educators to use, to describe, and monitor speaking and listening knowledge and skills. These frameworks assist educators to break language into its main components and examine the basic rule systems. The underpinning cognitive skills that support language learning are also discussed.",
        "The subject looks at developmental trends and implications for delayed language acquisition and language difficulties. It also explores signed and augmented alternative language systems.",
        "The subject examines a variety of formal and informal procedures and assessments to monitor language development and to identify strengths and areas of growth. Pedagogy associated with whole class instruction that fosters oracy along with evidence based small group and individual intervention strategies for learners with language difficulties are examined."
