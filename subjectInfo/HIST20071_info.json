    "overview": [
        "This subject offers a historical survey of American social, cultural, and political life from 1945 to the present. It charts the rise of the diverse and dynamic social movements that marked the post-WWII era: from civil rights to Black power; from women\u2019s liberation to gay liberation; anti-communist and anti-feminist activism; WTO protests and Occupy Wall St; to White nationalist movements and #BlackLivesMatter today. With a focus on the interplay between social movements and the political process, it examines the controversies surrounding and legacies of presidencies from Truman to Trump. The subject traces the cultural trends, economic developments and demographic shifts that have made the modern United States including the role of race and religion in American public life, the shift to a post-industrial service economy, debates over immigration, and the rise of state surveillance and big tech in the new millennium. With a focus on domestic rather than foreign affairs, the aim is to develop a deeper understanding of the historical forces that have shaped and continue to animate contemporary American life."
