        "This subject focuses on French language as a practical tool to communicate in authentic situations by means of regular activities both inside and outside the classroom. In terms of cultural knowledge, students will increase their historical awareness of France and French-speaking countries through a study of the French playwright Moli\u00e8re and 17th-century Europe and beyond. Using a variety of authentic materials on these topics, the subject will build on the formal study of French by developing the skills needed for oral and written comprehension and expression in France and French-speaking countries today. Students will be given the grammatical and lexical tools needed to become active storytellers. The subject will regularly relate the grammar rules studied in class to real-life contexts as well as to the structures encountered in the texts, films, and plays linked to the period studied and to contemporary French-speaking cultures."
