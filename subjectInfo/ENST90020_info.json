    "overview": [
        "This subject allows students to conduct an substantial independent, original research project in a specified area of environment and sustainability, in collaboration with an industry partner. The project addresses a real world problem in an industry context and comprises a review of a body of literature, a review and discussion of methodology and/ or an evaluation of research or experimental protocols and some original research.",
        "The specific focus of the research project will be initiated by either the student arising from their keen interests and consultations with other networks and academic staff with relevant expertise, or by an industry partner. Proposals for research projects must be submitted to the subject coordinator in the semester prior to commencement in the subject. Final approval for the topic lies with the subject coordinator.",
        "The work will be equivalent to lecture and practical based subjects worth 25 points. The work commitment includes regular one hour meetings with academic and industry partner supervisors where students report on progress, difficulties and research plans. Workshops conducted by the subject coordinator will deliver skill development in research practice including oral and written report presentation, with a focus on communication of research in interdisciplinary contexts."
