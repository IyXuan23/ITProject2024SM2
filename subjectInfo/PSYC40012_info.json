    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed to introduce students to the development and testing of models for psychological data, with a focus on models of human cognition. Quantitative data is a feature of all areas of psychology and can only be interpreted by use of an appropriate model. Modelling in psychology has two aims. The first is to find a quantitative description that accurately captures the data. The second is to test competing hypotheses about the psychological processes that generated the data. The methods of psychological modelling will be introduced and illustrated in selected areas of cognitive psychology.",
        "The subject comprises a series of nine two-hour seminars covering the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological issues involved in developing and evaluating quantitative models of human cognitive performance. The seminars are complemented by nine two-hour laboratory classes in which students will learn how to use the modelling language Matlab to fit, visualise, and evaluate models of data from specific cognitive domains, such as attention, categorisation, and decision making."
