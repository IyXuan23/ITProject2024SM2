        "Semester 2"
    ],
    "overview": [
        "This subject will enable students to understand how scientific discoveries from diagnostic, surveillance and basic research laboratories contribute to broader research programs in infection and immunity dedicated to the control of pathogens and disease within the wider population and environment. Through a series of lectures, seminars and discussion groups, students will learn about the principles of containment of specific pathogens within the laboratory setting, and the underlying regulatory framework required to maintain laboratory standards and progress biomedical discoveries. This subject will be taught by scientists who specialise in diagnostic, surveillance and basic research relating to specific infectious pathogens. The subject includes an optional 1-day (9am-4pm) excursion to CSIRO - Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong."
