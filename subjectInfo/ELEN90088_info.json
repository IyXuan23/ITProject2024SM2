            "The subject is designed and delivered using a project-based approach. Students  complete a self-designed half-semester project in small teams in addition to two guided workshops in the first half. Teaching team facilitates productive team-work and project-progress in workshop sessions.",
            "Recorded and interactive lectures, discussion boards, consultation hours, and workshops along with reading suggestions provide students a wide range of resources for their theoretical and practical project-based learning.",
            "The subject covers topics modern and industry-relevant topics. Students also practice and advance their soft-skills such as report writing, presentation, project scoping. The subject is enriched by a guest lecture from industry every semester showcasing real-world applications of the material covered."
