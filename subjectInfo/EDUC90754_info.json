    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed around the assumption that assessment practice and policy is a central component in successful school leadership and instructional decision making, and that assessment practice is a key tool for driving school improvement. Participants will explore a developmental approach to assessment, how this can be implemented in the classroom, and how assessment can be used at individual student level, at class-coordinator level, and at school leadership level. Participants will be engaged in reviewing approaches to student assessment, teacher use of assessment to make instructional decisions, and leadership use of assessment to inform curriculum, staffing, and school policy related matters. The subject will also consider how school leaders can work towards improving school assessment policy and practice. The subject aligns with the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership National Professional Standard for Principals."
