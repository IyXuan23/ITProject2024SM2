    "overview": [
        "This unit of study will provide students with an introduction to contemporary approaches to the development and evaluation of social policy. In particular, it will enable students to explore ways of involving those whose lives are to be affected by social policy, in the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of such policy (e.g., using co-production). The unit will use social, community, human and health services policy as case studies, with a particular emphasis on contemporary social policy as it relate to people with disability and disability service provisions. The seminars will include the participation of people with disability as experts in their lived experience of the implementation of social policy, as well as industry experts from community services and government agencies. Students will be expected to contribute to seminars based on both their own research conducted as part of the unit and, wherever possible, from their own lived experience of social policy development and implementation."
