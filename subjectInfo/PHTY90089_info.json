    "overview": [
        "This subject provides students with an opportunity to integrate prior knowledge of anatomy, physiology and neuroscience with theoretical and evidence-based knowledge in the management of individuals with neurological conditions. The emphasis of this subject is development of a clinical reasoning framework for the assessment and management of individuals with neurological conditions within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework. The selection and justification of assessment and management for individuals with neurological conditions will be informed by research findings from basic science and applied clinical research. Consideration will also be given to the rights of individuals with neurological conditions and the impact of team management processes in neurological physiotherapy practice. This subject includes 12 hours of clinical (generic) placement."
