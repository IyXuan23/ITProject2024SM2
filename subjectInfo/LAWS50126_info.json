    "overview": [
        "Sustainability Business Clinic provides a practical, clinical experience in which students are supervised in the provision of legal support to new and innovating enterprises. Clients will be identified as warranting assistance because they will contribute to community or environmental wellbeing but do not have the current capacity to pay for specialised legal assistance.",
        "Students will undertake 12 days of clinical work based at Melbourne Law School under the guidance and mentorship of the subject coordinator and lawyers with broad expertise in the relevant laws (including: climate and energy law; local government, environment and planning law; tort law; property law; employment and workplace health and safety law, and general corporate, transactional and business law). Students will use and refine the legal knowledge and skills acquired during their degree to undertake work on real legal issues and provide meaningful assistance to real clients, and in doing so, will be exposed to the realities of legal practice.",
        "Within the 12 days of clinical work students will participate in timetabled classes, in which areas of potential reform of the law to improve the prospect of emerging sustainable solutions to social and environmental problems will be discussed. Students will also take part in debrief sessions where students will evaluate their progress, discuss their perceptions of the law in practice, and reflect on the role of the law and their place in it.",
        "During timetabled classes, time will be also allocated to discuss and analyse the law relevant to client problems, with some direction on skills and legal practice as appropriate. Skills and doctrinal learning will also be undertaken during clinical work time."
