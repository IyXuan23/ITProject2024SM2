    "overview": [
        "The settler legal system in Australia has been built upon dispossession and erasure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as well as their land, laws and knowledges. Law continues to closely (over)regulate the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, while failing to properly protect Indigenous interests. This course will investigate the variety of ways in which settler law has operated to afford (and deny) rights and interests to Indigenous people, both as individuals and as polities.",
        "In this subject we will engage together with questions of Indigeneity, voice, recognition of Indigenous legal systems, settler-colonialism, sovereignty and self-determination as they relate to Australian legal systems and institutions. On this basis, the course will build upon and also reconsider the hegemonic knowledges introduced across a range of compulsory units in the Juris Doctor \u2013 including Principles of Public Law, Constitutional Law, Property, Criminal Law and Administrative Law.",
        "The subject brings together these bodies of law to engage with the emerging debates in Australian law and politics \u2013 such as who gets do define Aboriginality and how, how our Constitutional arrangements can best recognise and respond to Indigenous peoples, and how settler law and legal institutions may better account for the ongoing practice of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal systems.",
        "This course will place emphasis on engaging directly with key leaders in Indigenous justice, and engage closely with Indigenous writings on how to respond to and challenge the injustices towards Indigenous peoples perpetuated by the settler-colonial state. We will also consider and seek to build the skills and knowledges, including self-knowledge, which lawyers require to work effectively alongside Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their justice movements."

        "Recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander values as they relate to the diversity of Indigenous systems of law and justice operating in Australia today, and compare and contrast these to the values underpinning the settler legal system in Australia.",
        "Understand and articulate key debates around the legal definition of Indigeneity in Australia and the impacts of these debates on the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.",
        "Demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of a range of critical and theoretical perspectives on the relationship between the Australian settler state and Indigenous peoples, and key frameworks for understanding Indigenous rights and resistance in Australia.",
        "Critically analyse the ways in which Australian law is similar to, and differs from, other settler states and international law in the regulation of state-Indigenous relationships;",
        "Express their views clearly in writing and orally and to contribute to constructive public and scholarly debates on issues relating to Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination;",
        "Demonstrate analytic and problem-solving skills necessary to engage with complex legal disputes involving Indigenous peoples and their interests",
        "Develop racial literacy with the ability to critically evaluate specific representations of Indigenous Australians and settler Australians within legal texts;",
