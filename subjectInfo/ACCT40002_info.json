We examine research into the factors that influence the design of management accounting systems and the factors that influence the success of these systems. The subject content and delivery is designed around a framework of literature drawn from economics and behavioural theories. Students describe, discuss and critique research studies in management accounting, and build up to the development of their own research proposal."
