        "Geological mapping, core logging and the recognition of ore-related hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages are essential skills for all mining industry geologists. This field-based course will examine core and surface exposures of a mixed volcano-sedimentary succession in the highly mineralised Cambrian Mount Read Volcanics and Dundas Group of western Tasmania."
