    "overview": [
        "This subject investigates the linkages between social policy and development (including economic development) within developing countries. The November availability of this subject is taught as a University of Melbourne Overseas Subject in Indonesia. By learning 'in-country', the subject draws from the experience of Indonesia to understand the roles played by states, markets, civil society organisations and communities in responding to complex social policy issues such as poverty and welfare,  environmental change (affecting agriculture and other production), unemployment, old age, health, disability, and the socio-economic position of women. More specifically, the subject examines how efforts are made to instigate social policy via state-led policy formation and implementation at different levels of government, and through innovations from the civil society organisations, the private sector, international aid, and communities. The subject also explores debates on the relationship between social and economic development and the implications for social policy in multi-level and decentralised governance structures. Students learn from their experience examining these issues in Indonesia during the teaching period and apply this in their first assessment. The broader readings for the subject also examine similar social policy issues in other countries in the Asia Pacific. Students then use both their Indonesia experience and broader learning from the reading and their own research to investigate similar social policy challenges and responses in other country contexts in the Asia-Pacific for their second assessment.",
        "The November Availability of this subject is taught as a University of Melbourne Overseas Subject in Indonesia with our partner institution the University of Gadjah Mada. The subject will involve Masters students from both Melbourne and Masters students and staff from our Indonesian partner university. This provides an exciting opportunity for students from each University to learn with and from each other to gain deeper knowledge on tackling inequalities and understanding real-world development challenges and responses through social policy in lower-middle income countries. The subject also uses teaching mediums that connects students with experts in the field in Indonesia. There is a quota for this subject.
