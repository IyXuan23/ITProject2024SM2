        "Energy production and industrial activity produces chemical air pollutants that, in the absence of controls, create unsafe air, degrade the ozone layer, and heat our planet. This subject teaches students about the processes that lead to the formation of air pollutants, the mechanisms responsible for their transport and transformation in the environment, and the technological and regulatory options available for their control and abatement.",

Important air pollutants, including CO2, NOx, SOx, VOCs, particulate matter, halogenated compounds, and air toxics. Global impacts of air pollutants on human health and the environment. Mechanisms of air pollution formation and release. Engineering controls and regulatory abatement mechanisms for air pollution."
