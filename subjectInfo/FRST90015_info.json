    "overview": [
        "The interactions between spatial context and ecosystem composition and structure can have a significant influence on the management of our natural environment. Spatial and temporal patterning of ecosystems can influence ecosystem functioning which in turn can affect resource availability for flora and fauna, dynamics of plant communities, and lead to the alteration of disturbance regimes. Humans play a critical role in shaping the spatial context on ecosystems within landscapes, both creating and affecting these relationships. This subject will cover the principles of landscape ecology with a focus on understanding how spatial heterogeneity, spatial extent, agents of change (i.e. fire, climate) and the role of humans (i.e. forest management, urbanisation) influence ecosystem patterns and in turn ecological processes (i.e. plant migration, meta-population dynamics, provisioning of ecosystem services). Case studies will be drawn from international and domestic examples from urban, agricultural, and forested landscapes.",

        "This subject will involve lectures, practicals and a 3-day field trip."

        "Explain how changes in spatial patterns (i.e. fragmentation, connectivity, heterogeneity) impact on the conservation of flora and fauna;",
        "Demonstrate how human decisions and actions modify landscape patterns and processes and then predict and discuss the ecological implications for this locally, regionally and globally; and",
        "Use geographic information systems (GIS) and mechanistic models to investigate and identify spatial patterns and ecological processes at variety of spatial extents."
