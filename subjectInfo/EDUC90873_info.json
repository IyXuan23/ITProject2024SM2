        "This subject will explore the practical application of the emerging field of The Science of Learning (with a particular focus on Educational Neuroscience). The subject will provide students with an understanding of how science can inform classroom practice and how the application of scientific and design methodologies can be implemented in the creation, delivery and evaluation of learning interventions. Specifically, students will learn how neuroscience, psychology, and educational research can - and cannot - be successfully translated into classroom practice. More generally, students will be equipped with the skills to scientifically evaluate the validity of educational, psychological and neuroscientific research. These skills will allow students to become knowledgeable and effective consumers of commercial educational products and methods, enable them to critically reflect on their own teaching effectiveness in a scientifically valid way, and to develop novel and effective teaching practices.Specifically, the subject will address the following:",
        "Applying the science of learning to teaching and learning practices;",
        "applying neuroscience to practical human learning;",
        "specific learning topics (memory, attention, emotions, feedback, creativity);",
