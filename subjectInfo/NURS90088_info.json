        "Paediatric Nursing is designed to consolidate and extend the understanding of the theoretical aspects of paediatric nursing. It builds on the knowledge and skills learnt in Foundations in Paediatrics and expands the student\u2019s knowledge regarding a range of patients encountered in paediatric practice settings. Students will build on assessment skills and theoretical knowledge to include assessment and management of complex respiratory, cardiac, neurological, renal, metabolic, and surgical conditions. There is a continued emphasis on scientific principles and research evidence underpinning practice. Skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, rational inquiry and self-directed learning will be utilised to guide management of patient and family problems in specialty paediatric practice."
