They will also participate in regular conversation practice for the purpose of reinforcing their command of current idiomatic Italian. Students will explore aspects of contemporary Italian culture and language, through a critical analysis of a variety of texts and documents (including films, music, mass media and literature). By the end of the subject, students should have improved their written production skills and should be able to express themselves with fluency on most topics of a general nature."
