    "overview": [
        "Design Projects 3 provides a capstone experience for students in the Master of Design and Production to put into practice skills and knowledge developed in the first year of the program in their chosen specialisation of Stage Design, Production Design for Screen, or Graphic Design. Students work in leadership roles on VCA productions. For each production they will be required to develop, plan, execute and evaluate designs which creatively meet a complex set of demands within the constraints of defined resources such as time and budget.",
        "In lieu of a production, students may choose to undertake either a theoretical design project or a minor thesis of 10,000 words with the approval of the subject coordinator. Completion of a thesis meets the requirements for further study in a Graduate Research pathway.",
        "This subject is the first part of a two-subject sequence, taught over two consecutive study periods.Students are required to enrol in DPSS90004 Design Projects 3 Part 1 (25 points) and DPSS90005 Design Projects 3 Part 2 (25 points), consecutively, for a total enrolment of 50 points. Students will receive a 'CNT' grade for Part 1. An overall result for the subject is given following completion of the two-subject sequence.",
        "Assessment, Subject Intended Learning Outcomes, and Total Time Commitment applies to the entire enrolment across Parts 1 and 2 of the subject.",
        "The Total Time Commitment for the subject is approximately 680 hours, inclusive of the two study periods (DPSS90004 Design Projects 3 Part 1 (25 points) and DPSS90005 Design Projects 3 Part 2 (25 points))."
