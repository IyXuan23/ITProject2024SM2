        "Health Leadership & Digital Innovation is designed to help students develop business, leadership, management, and digital transformation skills. Students will have opportunities to broaden their understanding of the health professional's role beyond clinical practice and their ability to influence the wider healthcare context. Students will be encouraged to explore and examine healthcare challenges and opportunities and consider how these can influence health outcomes and health system performance. Students will explore leadership and management theories; develop skills in leadership style, teamwork, negotiation, conflict resolution, and change management.  Students will build knowledge and skills in business principles, strategy, and business planning. They will use an innovative and entrepreneurial approach, as well as consider the role of digital health transformation to advocate for change and influence resource allocation within the healthcare context."
