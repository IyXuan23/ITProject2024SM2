    "overview": [
        "Failure of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems may be acutely life threatening if adequate intervention is not forthcoming. Hence effective management of such cases will save lives that would otherwise be lost.  This subject provides the opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of these systems. Additionally, this subject covers foundational topics such as fluid therapy, shock and acid-base analysis. Understanding of these topics is highly advantageous if emergency patients are to be successfully managed. Students will build on knowledge that was acquired as an undergraduate and develop a deeper understanding and improved clinical confidence in these areas. A good understanding of this subject is highly desirable before continuing with further study in this course."
