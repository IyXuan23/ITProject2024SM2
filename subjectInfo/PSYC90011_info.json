    "overview": [
        "Psychologists need to be able to provide patients with the most appropriate treatment to address the presenting issues and problems that have brought them to treatment. To do this, psychologists must be able to: assess the patient\u2019s current situation and symptoms; understand how their history has influenced their current situation; and understand the patient\u2019s living circumstances, their own unique range of strengths and weaknesses, supports that are available, and other relevant factors. On the basis of this information, psychologists arrive at an individualised \u2018case formulation\u2019 which will then guide the clinician to the most appropriate treatment options.",
        "This subject covers a range of fundamental issues in psychological interviewing and testing in professional settings that enable a clinician to develop case formulations.  Specifically, students will be introduced to the principles and practice of diagnostic decision making, symptom assessment and monitoring, the logic of clinical inference-making, and the integration of material derived from the patient history with the mental state examination and other sources to arrive at a case formulation.",
