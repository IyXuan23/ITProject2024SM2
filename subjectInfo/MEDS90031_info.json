        "Foundations for Clinical Practice introduces students to the scientific knowledge and clinical skills required for medical practice. Core content covered includes foundational biomedical science knowledge and clinical communication and examination skills as well as a focus on early professional identity formation. Throughout the year, students work towards establishing introductory level clinical competencies while working under the guidance of tutors from a mixture of scientific and clinical professions. Students are expected to actively participate in a variety of different learning activities, both online and in person. These include webinars, interactive modules, tutorials, practical classes and clinical placements. Biomedical science knowledge is introduced and consolidated through small group exploration of clinically focused cases, which provide the context for understanding how major body system\u2019s structure and function contribute to patient health and well-being. Clinical skills are developed through use of peer learning, simulation and longitudinal community and hospital based clinical placements. A body systems approach guides learning throughout the year and emphasis is placed on three main streams of learning: Biomedical science knowledge; clinical skills; and professionalism in practice."
