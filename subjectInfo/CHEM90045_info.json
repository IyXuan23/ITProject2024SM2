        "This subject will explore the interrelationship between bonding, structure and reactivity in organic molecules. Fundamental concepts of modern physical organic chemistry such as molecular orbital theory, orbital symmetry control, of organic reactions and the nature of reactive intermediates will be discussed to provide students with a thorough understanding of chemical reactivity and mechanisms."
