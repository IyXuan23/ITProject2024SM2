    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on student's knowledge in radiology,  particularly as it applies to the neuro-musculo-skeletal system and conditions common to athletes of all ages and abilities (inclusive of adolescents, adult and senior athletes) in different sporting contexts. Students will develop advanced knowledge of anatomical structures and functions and use this knowledge to interpret radiological images. They will be able to explore normal and pathological findings as displayed by a variety of imaging modalities including x-ray, CT scans, MRI and US imaging. Students will understand terminology typically used for reporting radiology findings. They will have a better appreciation of when imaging is appropriate and which imaging modality is most appropriate for clinical decision-making in different contexts. They will understand how to communicate ethically and sensitively on the importance of radiological assessment to athletes, their carers, and other relevant persons (such as coaches) as appropriate and understand appropriate onward referral. A person\u2013centred approach will be adopted in this subject, with an expectation that students will be sensitive and informed about the athlete\u2019s experience in undergoing radiological investigations. Further, the students will have the opportunity to collaborate with other professionals, including experts to discuss evidence and innovations in the use of radiology in Sports Medicine and to build their understandings of best practice in the interest of the athlete/s.",
