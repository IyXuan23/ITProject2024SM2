    "overview": [
        "Virtually all aspects of crime and criminal justice are gendered. For instance, patterns of both offending and victimization follow heavily gendered patterns, while the criminal justice system is itself a traditionally \u2018masculine\u2019 institution. Likewise, both offending and victimization are implicated in the performance of gender identity. In this subject, students will be invited to critically interrogate ways in which gender shapes experiences of crime, victimisation and the operation of the criminal justice system, drawing on contemporary theory, research and applied case studies. This subject will also support students in developing the skills to communicate key theories, concepts, research and debates on gender and crime to a range of different audiences, utilising diverse mediums."
