    "overview": [
        "This subject will allow students to gain an understanding of the development of cities, land use, land values, role of planning, property rights and property ownership within an economic context. Students will learn to apply principles of neoclassical and institutional economics to the dynamic interrelationship between the economy and the built environment of city. Students will learn about the role of governmental and other institutions: through an analysis of land and property market outcomes and through an economic critique of legislation affecting land and property markets. The subject also introduces students to emerging discourses on equitable and sustainable cities.",
        "This subject will provide a lens on the University\u2019s Joining Melbourne Modules. These will be completed in parallel to the subject - unless already successfully completed. It will also support the Discovery goals for commencing students by introducing emerging concepts and research in the discipline area; ways to connect with the larger University community including peers, teachers and student groups; and awareness of academic expectations, and of wellbeing support offered at the University of Melbourne."
