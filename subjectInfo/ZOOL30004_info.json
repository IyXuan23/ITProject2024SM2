        "Is Darwin\u2019s extraordinary idea relevant for our species? The subject highlights the power of Darwin\u2019s theory of the evolution of adaptation by natural (and sexual) selection for understanding our origins and the present human condition, with an emphasis on exploring the claim that we cannot fully appreciate anthropogenic systems in the absence of an evolutionary perspective. The subject briefly examines the recent evolutionary history of hominids and highlights the challenges and significance of distinguishing between nature and nurture in shaping contemporary life-histories and behaviour. The subject focusses especially on the application of evolutionary theory to informing our understanding and management of global anthropogenic issues, including antibiotic, insecticide and other forms of resistance; vaccines and viruses; pathogen virulence; response to selection arising from environmental change, including pollution and climate; and the management of natural resources. Classes combine lectures and tutorials, and there is a strong emphasis on distinguishing between unsubstantiated conjecture and concepts that are supported by rigorous science.",
