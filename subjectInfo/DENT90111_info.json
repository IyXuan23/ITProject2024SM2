    "overview": [
        "This subject will be conducted as a pre-clinical laboratory subject building practical skills to prepare students for dental clinical practice. Students will develop initial manual dexterity and self-evaluation skills using virtual simulation facilities. Students will apply knowledge of disease processes, anatomy, common materials, equipment and instrumentation, and techniques for the management of caries (decay) and periodontal (gum) diseases. Students will undertake tasks on manikins to develop skills in preparing and restoring lost tooth structure (fillings), and in periodontal cleaning. Students will learn about correct posture, safety, and working as a team (assistant and operator) in the dental operatory during the provision of these procedures."
