        "This subject has been designed and developed for online delivery and assessment only.",
        "Embracing the tremendous diversity and strength of Indigenous arts practices with a focus on the south-east of Australia, this fully online subject gives a broad and holistic view of the roles played by First Nations artists and their contribution to the political landscape of Australia.",
        "Utilising Indigenous ways of mapping learning, students will chart their independent journeys through reflection on positionality and structural privilege by engaging with historical and contemporary impacts of colonisation in a non-linear digital inquiry-based approach over six modules.",

        "Students will reflect on their learning about First Nations perspectives, knowledges and artistic and cultural practices and the role of cultural reclamation for self-actualisation and resilience.",
        "",
        "This subject is developed and lead by Indigenous scholarship, pedagogies and knowledges in creative and cultural practices.",
        "This subject is taught by First Nations people."
