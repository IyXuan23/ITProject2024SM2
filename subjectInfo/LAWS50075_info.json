    "overview": [
        "This subject is about the legal protection of trade marks and elements of branding and reputation. It addresses three overlapping themes. The first involves a detailed treatment of Australian law \u2013 in particular the operation of the registered trade marks regime under theTrade Marks Act 1995(Cth) as well as the protection of trade marks and other commercial insignia under the common law tort of passing off and under the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions of trade practices legislation. The second involves the interrogation of the growing body of academic literature that seeks to answer important theoretical and practical questions about trade mark protection from a range of historical, economic, critical and cultural perspectives. Students will critically evaluate issues such as the scope of trade mark protection, the types of insignia that protection should cover and what uses should be permitted by third parties in commercial and artistic settings. Students will also consider the international trend towards expanded trade mark protection and how trade mark law has responded or should respond to new technologies and associated marketing practices. The third aspect compares the legal regimes in other jurisdictions \u2013 in particular, the United States, the European Union, the UK and New Zealand."
