    "overview": [
        "This subject, the third subject in the Bachelor of Medical Science (Degree with Honours), provides you with the opportunity to conduct an independent research project, in the form of either an advanced systematic review, meta-analysis or empirical project. Utilising the research proposal developed in the subject Advanced Medical Research, under supervision, you will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to execute a research project relevant to an identified clinical problem. Upon completion of this subject, you will produce a piece of original research demonstrating an effective writing style and reflecting sound reasoning, clarity of thinking and compliance with style requirements. In addition, during this subject, you will undertake an experiential placement in an area relevant to your research project. The aim of this placement is to advance your understanding and appreciation of the relationship between research and clinical practice, and to directly observe the application of evidence-based medicine."
