    "overview": [
        "This subject explores how publicly-held corporations in China, Taiwan and the United States are owned, controlled and governed. We will introduce the background of corporate governance, ownership structure, agency problems as well as issues of corporate purpose. Next, we will consider the primary actors, major regulations, and fiduciary duties. Lastly, we will discuss four topics; the distinctive features of state-owned enterprises; the distribution of powers between shareholders and board of directors; the regulation of related-party transactions; as well as investor protection, corporate restructuring, and securities law enforcement.",
        "In this subject, students will engage critically with key debates in contemporary corporate governance and provide relevant background for those interested in cross-border legal work."
