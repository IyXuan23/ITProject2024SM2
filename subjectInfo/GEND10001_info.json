    "overview": [
        "The world is gendered - but what is gender? We know gender is fundamental to the way in which we see ourselves and others, and how our communities and institutions are organised, but why? Why do gender norms and stereotypes emerge? What effects do they have on our lives? Drawing on feminist and queer theory, transgender studies, masculinity studies, and a range of disciplines across humanities and social sciences, this subject introduces students to the major concepts in gender studies, including: biological determinism, cultural essentialism, social constructionism, power and inequalities, sexuality, and queering categories of difference. Using a variety of case studies from social media, politics, sport, fashion, film, and music, the course will analyse how sex, gender, age, ethnicity, race, class, politics and social movements intersect to influence our understanding of sex, gender, and culture."
