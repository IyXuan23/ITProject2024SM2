    "overview": [
        "Fourier series and Fourier transforms are introduced as a means of representing and analysing functions of physical significance. The mathematical principles of Fourier theory are developed within the physical context of Fourier optics, diffraction theory, quantum mechanics and signal processing.",
        "The formulation of Classical Newtonian and Lagrangian mechanics is then discussed in the context of the symmetries of nature, conservation laws, Hamilton's equations and integration of the equations of motion. These principles are applied to the description of physical and mechanical systems and includes a detailed discussion of rotational and oscillatory motion, mechanical stability, collisions, scattering, diffusion and continuum mechanics.",
        "The emphasis in this subject will be to the development of techniques for solving problems involving a wide range of physical systems, including the formulation of appropriate mathematical and computational models and the identification of approximate solutions and limiting cases. Particular emphasis will be placed on the development of techniques that have wide applicability. Illustrative examples of these underlying principles will be drawn from classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and optics, electronics, geophysics, astrophysics, physical chemistry and physical biosciences."
