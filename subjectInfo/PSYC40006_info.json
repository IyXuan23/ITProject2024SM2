    "overview": [
        "In this subject, students develop the knowledge and skills to prepare them for professional practice in psychology, focusing on ethical and evidence-based practice grounded in the scientist-practitioner model.",
        "Students will learn about the ethical codes that govern psychological research and practice, and apply these in varied contexts and scenarios, incorporating relevant legal frameworks relating to privacy and human rights.  Students will also be given the opportunity to learn and practice foundational interviewing and behaviour change skills used in varied contexts, and will observe and practice pre-professional skills in the implementation and interpretation of some of the most commonly used tests of cognition and personality.",
        "Evidence-based practice is emphasised as  a core ethical issue in psychological practice. Framed within the 'scientist-practitioner' model, it provides a means of evaluating the efficacy of psychological interventions. Students will gain an understanding of the theoretical and empirical bases of psychological assessment and intervention, and will learn to critically analyse the assumptions underlying different approaches to psychological research and evidence-based practice, including assumptions relating to the applicability of psychological interventions and tests across cultures. Special consideration is given to developing sensitivity to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples."
