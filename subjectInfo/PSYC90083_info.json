    "overview": [
        "The subject provides a cognitive neuroscience perspective on the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive processes that are commonly impaired in conditions confronted by neuropsychologists. The subject will describe the basic cognitive neuroscience (e.g., cortical structure, function and psychopharmacology) underpinning critical cognitive processes such as memory, executive function and attention, and application to understanding dysfunction of these processes in clinical conditions.  Additionally, the subject will provide students with an introduction to medications used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders."
