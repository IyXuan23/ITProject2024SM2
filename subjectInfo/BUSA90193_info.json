    "overview": [
        "Managerial economics is designed to provide you with the tools of economic reasoning for developing and evaluating strategic business options and to make better choices. To this end we discuss and develop the fundamental economic concepts and analytical skills required in managerial and strategic decision-making. Applications lie in bargaining, price setting, the analysis of different market environments, and the analysis of situations with asymmetric information. Many subjects\u2014and in particular business strategy, finance, marketing, and negotiations\u2014build upon the material learned in Managerial Economics. To benefit from these synergies you are encouraged to take Managerial Economics early in your program."
