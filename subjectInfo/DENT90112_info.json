    "overview": [
        "An understanding of disease processes is vital to their management and prevention. Through this subject, students will develop and apply their knowledge of aetiology, pathogenesis, management and prevention of diseases and conditions affecting the dental and periodontal hard and soft tissues, and the orofacial complex. The subject will focus on periodontitis and dental caries, the common diseases caused by dental plaque bacteria, and pathology and therapeutics in dental practice. Students will learn about health and disease at a community, individual, cellular and molecular level, and the links between oral and systemic health. Students will learn how to make diagnostic and management decisions and will learn about effective prevention of oral diseases. Topics integrated within this subject include microbiology, chemistry, biochemistry, immunology, pathology, therapeutics and clinical practice that are relevant to understanding oral and general health and disease.",
        "Students will engage in a variety of learning activities including lectures, online learning modules and clinical case discussions."
