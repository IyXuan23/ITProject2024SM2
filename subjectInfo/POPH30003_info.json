        "Real World Epidemiology is one of the four subjects in the Public Health and Epidemiology major in the Bachelor of Biomedicine.",
        "In this subject, students will apply their new epidemiological skills and knowledge to real-life health and public health scenarios. Within the different scenarios encountered students will be asked to make decisions as health professionals and public health professional based on their interpretation of the epidemiological evidence. A variety of non-communicable diseases, injuries and infectious diseases will be considered in the scenarios presented. Students will consider the issues that can occur in epidemiological investigations and how such issues can lead to incorrect healthcare and public health decisions being made. Students will also learn how to synthesise and present the evidence from epidemiological studies and learn how to choose the best evidence to base decisions on for specific populations. Within this subject the different components of health systems will be explored and how epidemiological evidence can be used to improve policy and practice will be discussed. Students will also learn to develop mathematical models to predict the trajectory of infection spread. The hands-on delivery of this subject combining lectures, Q&A sessions and tutorials allows the students to practically apply their new skills to scenarios that mirror current real-world health challenges.",
        "This subject would be appropriate for students considering careers in public health, the health professions or health research."
