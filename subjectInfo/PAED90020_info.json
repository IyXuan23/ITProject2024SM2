        "Together with WELF90009 Genetic Counselling Practice 1 and WELF90008 Genetic Counselling Practice 2, this subject comprises a comprehensive series of courses that enable students to seamlessly integrate theoretical concepts with practical application. Successful completion of this year-long subject necessitates a minimum of 48 days of clinical placements in clinical genetics settings",
        "In this subject, students will engage in a dynamic learning experience that combines observation, supervised practice, and increasing levels of responsibility throughout their clinical placements. The aim is to develop the necessary skills and core competencies required for professional certification by the Human Genetics Society of Australasia (HGSA) (Competency Standards for GCs.pdf (hgsa.org.au)).",
        "Throughout the subject, students will have the opportunity to reflect critically on the scope of practice of genetic counselling and understand the pivotal role of genetic counsellors within multidisciplinary teams (LO1). They will also explore and integrate relevant counselling and communication theories into their practice through observation and hands-on experience (LO2).",
        "Supervision will play a key role in this subject, allowing students to engage in discussions and critical reflections on ethical issues, thereby enhancing their self-awareness (LO3). By actively participating in client consultations, creating comprehensive long case reports, maintaining logbooks, and receiving supervision, students will demonstrate the application of core competencies expected of entry-level genetic counsellors as defined by the HGSA (LO4). These core competencies include effective communication skills, reflective practice, critical thinking, proficient case management abilities, and maintaining professional and ethical standards."
