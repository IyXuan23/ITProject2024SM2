        "his subject involves the development and application of the tools of bioinformatics to address a significant research problem. The subject also provides students with skills and knowledge for understanding original research and enhanced written and oral communication skills.",
        "The process of matching students with supervisors and research projects will occur in the first semester of enrolment of the Bioinformatics stream of the Master of Science. Apart from the help and guidance from their supervisor(s) each student also has a committee that regularly meets with them and provides additional help and expertise. This committee is responsible for assessment of the research project subject.",
