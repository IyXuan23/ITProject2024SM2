    "overview": [
        "This subject, the second subject in the Bachelor of Medical Science (Degree with Honours), will extend and integrate the knowledge and skills acquired in Introduction to Medical Research subject, by employing and implementing techniques that will locate, synthesise and evaluate medical and research evidence, and apply this knowledge to illustrate how these findings can inform clinical healthcare and best practice. This research into practice will focus on the challenges associated with updating clinical practice and \u2018knowledge transfer\u2019 and will cover scientific communication, clinical guideline development, clinical informatics and translation. You will further extend the knowledge and application of statistical techniques learnt in the Introduction to Medical Research subject to the interpretation of statistical findings presented in research papers. In this subject, you will also be paired with a clinical research mentor and under their supervision develop a research proposal on a relevant clinical problem. This proposal forms the basis of the advanced systemic review, meta-analysis or research project that is threaded to, and completed, in the subject \u2018Project in Medical Research\u2019."
