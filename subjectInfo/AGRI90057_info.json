        "Global food production is facing many challenges to meet current and future demand. Impacts of climate change on agriculture will add stress to our ability to produce enough food for a growing population with fewer resources. Adapting agriculture to climate change to meet these needs is a critical challenge for current and future generations.",
        "This subject will examine the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural production and explore adaptation options within various sectors of agriculture and food production. This exploration of adaptation options will include consideration of barriers that may hinder effective adaptation."
