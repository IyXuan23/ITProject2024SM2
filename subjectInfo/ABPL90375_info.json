        "This subject is the culmination of each student's studies in Master of Landscape Architecture. Students will be offered a studio thematic which provides scope for an original approach to design synthesis in landscape architecture, which is based on research and critical thinking. These studios may offer an interdisciplinary experience with students working alongside others in a parallel design discipline.Students will be expected to demonstrate mastery of design resolution, conceptual engagement and aesthetic expression.With course coordinator approval, high-achieving students may undertake the Landscape Architecture Design Thesis as an individually supervised design investigation. Similarly, under exceptional circumstances and with course coordinator approval, the Design Thesis may be undertaken as a written thesis.",
