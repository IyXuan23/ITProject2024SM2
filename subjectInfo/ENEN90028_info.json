            "LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODSThis subject is centred on a team-based project. Each tutorial group of up to 35 students will design, implement, and train others to implement a number of monitoring programs to detect human impacts on the environment. Tutorial groups deal either with aquatic or terrestrial environments. Within tutorial groups, students form small teams of approximately four to examine a particular environmental impact. During the first eight weeks of semester they develop their monitoring program in stages with guidance from tutors and a one-hour weekly lecture. These teams must coordinate their plans with other teams in their tutorial group to share equipment, data and transport between field sites. There is a five-day field camp scheduled around the mid-semester break. During the field camp the teams carry out and refine their monitoring program, teach other teams their field procedures, and then apply procedures developed by other groups. Results must be compiled during field camp and presented both in oral and written form. Students work individually following the field camp to analyse results and make some conclusion concerning environmental impacts.INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCESLecture notes. Scientific literature specific to topics selected by each team, texts dealing with monitoring of environmental impacts and in particular:Downes, B.J., Barmuta, L.A., Fairweather, P.G., Faith, D.P., Keough, M.J., Lake, P.S., Mapstone, B.D. and Quinn, G.P.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKSAn industry presentation on one evening of the field camp is given by a practitioner involved with monitoring environmental impacts of engineering projects and this is followed by a discussion and questions session.The Melbourne School of Engineering OHS officer provides a lecture on the importance of OHS procedures and risk assessment.",
