        "AIMSThis subject is aimed at teaching the scientific principles associated with extreme events including that of earthquakes, impact, blast and cyclonic wind and their effects on a structure. Students will also be trained to make effective use of state-of-the-art techniques in quantifying the effects of the design actions in order that suitable level of protection can be incorporated into the structure to counter an extreme event. At the conclusion of this subject students should be capable of modelling a variety of extreme loadings by employing advanced techniques. Students will also be able to apply the modelling methodologies to fulfil performance based design objectives. Improved proficiencies in countering extreme loading in the design of structures will achieve better economy and a more sustainable built environment. This subject builds on students\u2019 fundamental knowledge of engineering mathematics, mechanics and structural analysis. With frequency of extreme events increasing due to climate change, increased mass and speed of vehicles and terrorism, this subject provides graduates with specialist knowledge to work in the field of hazard reduction or avoidance under the guidance of a chartered engineer.INDICATIVE CONTENTTopics covered include Rayleigh Method for developing a simplified model of a structural element, hand calculation techniques for analysing the impact action of a solid object based on linear elastic and elasto-plastic behaviour of the structure, considerations for the conditions of contact and anomalies associated with contributions by the higher modes. Another major topic to be covered is the capacity spectrum method involving linear, or non-linear, static analysis for the assessment of a building structure subject to seismic actions. Other topics include the analysis of blast actions by hand calculations and phenomena associated with the aerodynamic actions of wind."
