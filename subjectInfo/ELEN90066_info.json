        "This subject provides a practical introduction to the basics of modelling, analysis, and design of microprocessor-based embedded systems. Students will learn how to integrate computation with physical processes to meet a desired specification within the context of a design project. The project work will expose students to the various stages in an engineering project (design, implementation, testing and documentation) and a range of embedded system concepts.INDICATIVE CONTENT",
        "Topics covered may include: digital computer and microprocessor architectures, modelling of dynamic behaviours, control, models of computation, operating systems concepts, multi-tasking, resource management and real-time behaviours, interfacing with the physical world, analysis and verification, safety, reliability, and security and privacy.This material will be complemented by exposure to standard software tools including compilers and debuggers, finite state machine design and analysis software, and simulation tools. The subject will include a level of industry engagement, to provide broader examples of engineering projects, through guest lectures."

        "3. Develop and test the low-level software components of an embedded system using software tools to simulate and verify its behaviour",
        "4. Conduct a small embedded system design project"
