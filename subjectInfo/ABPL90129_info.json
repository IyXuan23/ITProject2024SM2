    "overview": [
        "Successful project development depends on pro-active cost management from feasibility through to design, tender and construction, to the completion and useful life of the project. This subject examines applications of economics, management, law and statistical techniques to construction cost economics and management.",
        "Topics include: advanced cost modelling techniques with parametric and probabilistic cost estimating methods; cost-in-use studies and life-cost approach to building evaluation (LCC in practice); feasibility studies and financial decision-making; value management; tender analysis; construction claims, conflict and dispute management; professional practice in quantity surveying including professional ethics; the role of quantity surveyors during construction as it affects the valuation of preliminaries, fluctuations, change orders and accounts, provisional sums and prime cost sums, as well as the role of quantity surveyors in risk assessment.",
        "Principles of professional liability in quantity surveying practice as well as the impact of advanced digital technology such as Building Information Modelling on Cost management are also examined."
