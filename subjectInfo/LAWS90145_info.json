    "overview": [
        "Historically a computer was \u201cprogrammed\u201d by a human utilising a precise set of instructions. Within this paradigm the computer was able to \u201cprocess\u201d information \u201cfed\u201d to it and produce a particular output based on such programming and information.",
        "The human input was clear and transparent. As artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved in concert with the internet, cloud computing, big data gathering, data storage and data processing capabilities and the ubiquitous uptake of interactive smartphones and other \u201csmart\u201d devices, the relationship between the computer and direct and immediate human stewardship or control of outputs has become less readily identifiable. In turn this has given rise to significant legal issues.",
        "There are substantial legal implications of AI which require ongoing, flexible and informed responses from lawyers and legal policy makers. This subject seeks to inform practicing lawyers, legal policy makers and non-lawyers in respect of those issues and how they might be dealt with.",
