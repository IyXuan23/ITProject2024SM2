        "This subject offers an introduction to development project management and design from interdisciplinary and critical perspectives. We begin by understanding the standard project cycle approach to project management. We focus on strategy, vision and mission formulation, as well as problem identification and analysis, objectives analysis, stakeholder analysis, formulation of projects and budgets, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. We will examine how different functions require different forms of program design and planning. Students will be familiarised with the 'Logframe Approach' and 'Theory of Change', which will be contrasted with \u2018Learning Process\u2019, 'Strengths Based' and 'Social enterprise' approaches to project design. Students will explore participation and empowerment as methodologies to address gender and other power inequalities specific to disadvantaged groups, and consider the ethics and motivations of field workers. Students will also be introduced to recent critiques of, and debates on, project management and development practice. Case studies of projects in developing countries, practical exercises including a group project, andcritically reflective learningwill be integral to the syllabus.",
