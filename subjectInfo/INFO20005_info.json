        "A crucial skill in developing interactive systems is building clear and well-designed user interfaces across a range of technologies. In this subject, students will learn how to design and build user interfaces. The subject will introduce methods, techniques, and principles of visual communication applied to the design of user interfaces. Using state-of-the-art tools, students will iteratively design and prototype a novel user interface, going from concept to implementation through increasing levels of fidelity. Around this process students will learn how to iteratively translate requirements and intentions into design constructs and working interface prototypes."
