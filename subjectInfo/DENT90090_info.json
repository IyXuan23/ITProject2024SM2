    "overview": [
        "This subject is the first part of a 3 year inter-related series of subjects that are expected to be taken contiguously, which introduces students to knowledge in the oral medicine field.  The subject provides basic teachings on the aetiology, pathogenesis, immunology and clinical aspects of oral medicine, specifically with regard to oral mucosal lesions, orofacial pain or temporomandibular dysfunction.",
        "This subject aims to provide the student a broad understanding of the oral pathology, and experience in diagnosing and treating diseases of the oral mucosa and oro-facial pain through participation in regular seminars and review meetings. They will begin developing the competencies to recognise diseases and their associated risk factors, and to understand the full range of clinical treatment services in oral medicine. They will form inter-disciplinary relationships across the environment of medical, dental and allied health professionals.",
        "The clinical component of the subject will provide supervised opportunities for students to understand the process of managing patients with oral mucosal disorders, oral manifestations of systemic disease and the assessment and treatment of patients with oro-facial pain during the clinical component of the subject. Assessment of clinical performance will include written paper and oral examinations on both clinical skills, and introductory understanding of histological diagnosis and patient management. Students will be required to pass all sections (clinical, laboratory and theory) of this subject.",
        "Students will partake in weekly teaching sessions of Doctor of Dental Surgery students."
