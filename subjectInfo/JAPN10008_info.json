        "This subject is designed for students who have successfully completed Japanese 3 and can recognise around 250 Kanji characters. In this subject, students will be introduced to around 100 new Kanji characters. They will develop communication skills to deal with formal interaction genres such as service encounters and job interviews. Students will also be introduced to formal written correspondence genre, such as thank-you letters and emails using honorific expressions. Students will have an opportunity to conduct online research about the Japanese writing system, and engage in discussion and interaction with others to put intercultural communication into practice. Students will also have an opportunity to engage in peer-review and will interact with other students. In addition, students will develop intercultural understanding through identification of common Japanese methods and routines in expressing personal feelings, then draw comparison between their own culture."
