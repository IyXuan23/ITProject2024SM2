        "This subject introduces students to hearing sciences, how we hear, and the impact of hearing loss on communication. Students will learn about the properties of sound and how this is utilised to hear. Students will also understand the impact on the individual and on the sound processing when there is a hearing loss present. The basics of rehabilitation options for individuals with hearing loss will also be explored. By the end of this subject, students will understand the properties of sound, how sound is processed by the auditory system, and how this processing may be affected in individuals with hearing loss. The subject also explores the impact of hearing loss on communication and the intervention options available."
