    "overview": [
        "Social Computing is a field of study that investigates computing techniques and systems to support, mediate, and understand aspects of social behaviours. Understanding the principles and foundations of Social Computing is important because of the rapid proliferation of social systems, particularly those aimed at end-users (e.g. social networking websites, crowd sourcing platforms, knowledge sharing platforms, etc.). This subject will introduce you to key concepts and principles of Social Computing, and provide you with training to investigate how these systems influence human behaviours, how to improve current implementations, and how to identify ways to better support social activities and interactions."

The lectures cover important aspects for the design and development of social systems, while the workshops provide students with hands-on exercises to consolidate knowledge acquired during the lectures. A significant amount of project work is assigned.INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCESA number of scientific readings are given to offer a holistic view of the different topics covered throughout the semester. Lecture slides are also available online, as well as links to relevant content.CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKSSocial systems are ubiquitous, and knowledge on how to effectivetly design them is an increasingly important skill within the IT industry. This subject assists students in developing important IT-related skills, such as User Interface and User Experience design."
