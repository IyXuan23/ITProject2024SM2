        "This subject aims to introduce students to the application of programming and computational methods to solve problems in the context of bioengineering research and industry. It introduces students to the fundamentals of software programming and computational methods via the use of programming languages. These techniques will be explored in the context of problems drawn from different aspects of bioengineering including, but not restricted to, fluid mechanics, image processing, electromagnetism, control systems, biomechanics, biomaterials, biosignals and clinical statistics.",
