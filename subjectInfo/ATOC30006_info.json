        "The main area of study in this subject is the examination of the key processes that maintain our present climate and how these may change into the future with climate change. We examine this by studying the controlling mechanisms for key conserved quantities in the Earth System such as energy, moisture, angular momentum and key trace gases.",
        "The subject also introduces the various techniques used for climate predictions globally and locally. These include the modelling of climate change and the use of emission scenarios. Interpretation and statistical analysis of future-climate scenarios and the use of ensemble simulations."

        "Interpret the role of model uncertainty in attribution and prediction of climate change",
