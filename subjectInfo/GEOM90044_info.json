    "overview": [
        "This course will introduce the concept of a GIS as a problem solving technology within the geosciences, and through hands-on practical classes and lectures will provide the basic hands-on skills needed to design and implement a GIS project. Specific topics will include map projections and georeferencing, distortions in image data, raster and vector data models, incorporating digital terrain models and geophysical data, introduction to boolean logic and functions, data accuracy and access issues and limitations of GIS. The course will include examination of case histories of GIS projects and students will also build a GIS project of their own to solve a simulated exploration problem using MapInfo and other open-source software and a real world data set."
