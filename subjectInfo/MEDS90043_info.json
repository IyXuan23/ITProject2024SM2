        "Discovery 3: Research Scholar is the first subject dedicated to the Research Scholar pathway in the MD. The Research Scholar pathway leads to advanced knowledge and skills in the design and conduct of research and is suited to students with a desire to extend their capacity for producing original research that contributes to evidence-based healthcare and establishes their professional identity as a clinician researcher. This subject builds on the foundation level research methods knowledge and skills from their prior studies in the MD.",
        "Undertaken as a 4-week intensive subject in the third year of the Discovery stream, students will commence work on a research project, under the supervision of an experienced researcher. This is the first step of the research project, which will be continued and completed in the following year in the Discovery 4: Research Scholar subject. In this subject, students will work closely with their supervisor and research team to develop their research question, conduct a literature review and propose a detailed research project plan. The subject will allow students to develop research skills tailored to their project, preparing them to undertake their proposed project in Discovery 4: Research Scholar. Students will also have the opportunity to work collaboratively with their supervisor and research group to establish a professional working relationship as a clinician researcher.",
        "This subject is the first step of the research project and is a pre-requisite for Discovery 4 Research Scholar, which will be continued and completed in the following year in the Research Scholar Discovery 4 subject (under the supervision of the same researcher)."
