    "overview": [
        "This subject provides the basis for the study of periodontics that is concerned with diseases that may affect the supporting structures of teeth. Learning is achieved through a series of weekly 3-hour seminars as well as clinical placements. The subject will introduce a student to the areas of aetiology, pathogenesis, immunology and clinical periodontics and clinical management including examination, treatment planning and non-surgical treatment of periodontal patients with basic surgical therapy.The subject aims to form a student\u2019s understanding of the biological basis of diseases of the periodontium, from the development of the periodontal apparatus through to the processes involved in destruction and repair of these tissues. They will be introduced to areas of periodontal diseases distribution in the population, the natural course of the disease process and the effects of varying treatment and preventive modalities on the course of the disease, as based upon critical reading of the scientific literature.The student will be introduced to the rationale for treatment and the influence of supra- and sub-gingival instrumentation on the epithelium, connective tissue, cementum and alveolar bone, and how these changes should be associated with the impact of treatment on the microflora. The subject will develop a student\u2019s ability to analyse factors related to risk of periodontal disease and the assessment of risk and in-depth knowledge of periodontal examination, diagnosis, prognosis and initial periodontal therapy and re-evaluation."
