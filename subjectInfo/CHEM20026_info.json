    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces the chemical logic of cellular processes, and the chemical methods used to probe and perturb them. Coverage includes: the major classes of biomolecules and their biosynthesis with a focus on molecular structure; biological catalysis (enzymes, enzyme kinetics and the roles of trace metals and co-factors); and chemical methods for studying interactions and deconvoluting biological systems.",
        "Also covered are chemical techniques for qualitative and quantitative analysis of cellular processes and biomolecular interactions; imaging techniques for non-invasive analysis; analytical techniques and equipment for biomolecular studies; and common molecular tools.",
        "A key aspect of this subject will be the use of case studies to explore how chemical approaches can be applied to illuminate the molecular features of biological systems. This will be covered in a small-group learning mode and involve both a written report and oral presentation."
