    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the Primary Humanities domains of Geography, History, Economics and Business, and Civics and Citizenship. Teacher Candidates will be introduced to the Humanities as a broad, complex and dynamic field concerned with people as social beings who interact with one another and with natural and social environments through time and place.  This subject references the Australian/ Victorian Curricula. This subject aims to explore how the Humanities curriculum can be designed to help students understand the world around them in local, national and global contexts. This includes learning about diversity, worldviews and democratic principles to enable students to participate in our world as informed citizens.",
        "Teacher Candidates will consider how the Humanities can be linked with other curriculum areas and in contexts beyond the school classroom. They will explore the important role technologies play in transforming, restoring and sustaining societies and supporting students to be regional and global citizens. Teacher Candidates will apply their understanding through inquiry-based curriculum design. Through the inquiry process, opportunities for active and informed citizenship will be explored. General capabilities will be addressed such as critical and creative thinking, intercultural understanding, ethical understanding and personal and social responsibility."
