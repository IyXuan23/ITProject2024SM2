        "Advanced Accounting 2 is a year-long subject in the second year of the Master of Commerce (Accounting) Program. This subject provides a rigorous review and critical analysis of the theory and methodology underlying economics-based research in a specific area of accounting that was of interest to students during their first year of the Master of Commerce (Accounting) Program. The objective is to provide students with more advanced understanding of research topics, developments, and methodologies in the specific area of accounting. The specific area of accounting that students choose should relate to any of the subdisciplines covered in one of the core accounting subject taken in the first year of coursework and/or align with the research interests of academic staff in the Department. Students should notify the Director of the Doctoral Program or nominee of their specific area of interest. This is due by the end of January to allow sufficient time for the approval of the student\u2019s chosen area of interest and allocation of appropriate academic staff advisor."
