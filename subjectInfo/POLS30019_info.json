        "This subject provides an introduction to Australian foreign policy, exploring its domestic and global contexts. It examines Australia's most important bilateral, regional, and multilateral relations in both historical and contemporary terms. It explores key themes including Australia's national identity, interests, security and prosperity, the Australia-US alliance, its multilateral relationships, Australia's role as a regional power, and Australia's increasing engagement with Asia. The subject also investigates key foreign policy issues on the contemporary Australian agenda including global climate change negotiations, human rights, overseas aid and asylum-seekers, trade and economic globalisation, and arms control. Students who complete this subject will be equipped to articulate and debate the conceptual, analytical, and normative dimensions of Australian foreign policy.",
