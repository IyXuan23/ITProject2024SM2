        "This subject supports the development of advanced nursing practice knowledge in the quality use of medicines by exploring the clinical and social contexts for the safe use of medicines. The subject meets the needs of multiple cohorts of students with varying levels of experience and scope of practice. It extends students' knowledge of social and ethical principles of medication management and allows the student to explore how these principles are applied in the nursing practice setting. Furthermore, this subject incorporates application of science to clinically relevant context with a focus on medication management and supporting prescribing."
