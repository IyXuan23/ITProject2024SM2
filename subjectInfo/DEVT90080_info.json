    "overview": [
        "This subject will use a decolonial, intersectional feminist approach to address the following core questions: How can development programs redress gender inequalities? What are the challenges in applying an intersectional, decolonial feminist approach to development programs and practice? What are the prospects for the re-politicisation of the \u2018gender mainstreaming\u2019 agenda?",
        "The subject will offer students the opportunity to undertake a critical and inter-disciplinary review of five decades of gender analysis in development programmes and practice. By undertaking practical scenario exercises and analysing case studies of projects in developing countries, students will learn tools and skills in gender analysis frameworks, gender mainstreaming, gender budgets, care analysis, programming with men and boys, and organising collective action."
