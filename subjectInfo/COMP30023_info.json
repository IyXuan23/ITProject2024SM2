        "Over the last half-century, computers have improved at a faster rate than almost any other technology on the planet, yet the principles on which they work have remained mostly constant. In this subject, students will learn how computer systems work \"under the hood\".",
        "The specific aim of this subject is for the students to develop an understanding of the basic concepts underlying computer systems. A key focus of this subject is the introduction of operating systems principles and computer network protocols. This knowledge is essential for writing secure software, for writing high performance software, and for writing network-based services and applications.",

            "The subject is delivered through a combination of lectures and workshops (tutorial and individual/group work). Students get a hands-on introduction to advanced programming through a series of problem solving exercises. Tasks will encapsulate operating system fundamentals and computer network protocols and services. Students will then go on to complete project work. Students will also learn how to use basic cryptographic primitives to protect data privacy and integrity. Students will begin to gain an understanding of how to analyse cryptographic protocols and what degree of privacy and integrity they achieve.",
            "INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCES",
            "Students have access to lecture notes, lecture slides, tutorial worksheets, a programming environment and the Department servers. The subject LMS site contains links to recommended resources relating to basic/advanced programming, and advanced problems resources relating to basic/advanced programming, and advanced problems for students who want to extend themselves.",
            "CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKS",
            "The IT industry is a large and steadily growing industry. Skills in operating systems and programming development that exploits the underlying computer system are essential for working in the IT industry, for example in software development companies, website development companies, telecommunication companies and game development companies. There is scope for a range of companies/organisations to be involved in the delivery of the subject (through guest lectures etc.) including AURIN (Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network: geomatics, distributed computing, web development), VLSCI (Victorian Life Sciences Computing distributed computing, big data)."
