    "overview": [
        "This subject covers aspects related to particle technology including powder and suspension processing. Initially, the student learns how to describe particles and systems of particles in terms of size, shape and distribution. Particle formation and synthesis will be covered.  Understanding of the basic mechanics of fluid flow around particles is described. This knowledge is used as the basis for designing unit operations associated with powders and suspensions, including particle classification, particle breakage (comminution) and agglomeration, packed beds and fluidisation, flotation and powder storage in hoppers.  Particle systems will be simulated using Discrete Element Modelling.  The combination and variety of topics in this subject provides students with an appreciation of particulate processing. This knowledge is vital for numerous industries including (but not limited to) mineral processing, potable water treatment, wastewater treatment, food and pharmaceuticals.",
