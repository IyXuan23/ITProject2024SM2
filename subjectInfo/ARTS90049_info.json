        "The subject offers a critical approach to the study of gender and sexuality through the exploration of a range of conceptual and methodological approaches central to the study of gender and sexuality, such as: intersectionality, situated knowledge, indigenous knowledge, media and representation, queering categories of difference, and affective methodologies. This subject is structured around six thematic workshops that are formed around contemporary debates in the fields of gender and sexuality.",
        "The subject is designed for students who wish to deepen their existing knowledge of gender theories as well as for those who are interested in exploring how engaging with gender theories and methods might open up their projects in unexpected and useful ways. The subject will include guest lectures by gender studies specialists."
