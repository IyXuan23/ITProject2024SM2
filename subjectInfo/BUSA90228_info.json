    "overview": [
        "In fiercely competitive global and dynamic environments, companies face increasing pressures to exceed customer expectations along multiple performance measures, such as cost, quality, flexibility and innovativeness. To outperform their competitors, many firms make the mistake of mimicking their rivals, rather than focusing on developing the organisational capabilities that competitors will find difficult to match over the long term. And although operations are at the core of a firm\u2019s value adding activities, few firms have sought to build a sustainable competitive advantage around these capabilities.",
        "The focus of the course will be to highlight how firms should design, manage and continually improve their business and operational processes to better manage the mismatch between supply and demand. It aims at providing some of the core concepts in operations that are essential for appreciating how operational capabilities can help organisations achieve sustainable competitive advantage. This course provides a logical and rigorous approach to plan and control process structure and managerial levers to achieve desired business process performance."
