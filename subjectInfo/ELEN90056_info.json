        "This subject provides an in-depth coverage of transistor (MOSFET and BJT) devices and their use in common circuits. In particular, students will study topics including: transistor operating modes and switching; principles of CMOS circuits; transistor biasing; current-source/emitter-amplifiers; low-frequency response; followers; class B amplifiers; current limiting; current sources and mirrors; differential pairs; feedback in amplifiers and stability; operational amplifiers; operational amplifier circuits; and voltage regulation. This material will be complemented by exposure to circuit simulation software tools and the opportunity to further develop circuit construction/test skills in the laboratory.INDICATIVE CONTENT",
