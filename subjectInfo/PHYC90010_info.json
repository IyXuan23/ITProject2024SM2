        "This subject provides an advanced introduction to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The subject focuses on collective phenomena in complex many-body systems with an emphasis on diffusive processes, stability and the emergence of long-range order, with examples drawn from physics, chemistry, biology and economics. Specific topics include diffusive stochastic processes (Fokker-Planck equations), birth-death processes (master equations), kinetic transport, and spatio-temporal pattern formation in unstable nonlinear systems (bifurcations, chaos, reaction-diffusion equations)."
