        "New Product development is an important source of growth and profitability as existing markets become price competitive and saturated. However, the process of new product development is fraught with risk. In this course we study the process of managing products and how companies can manage their introduction and elimination from the product portfolio. We review how these decisions are made within the context of profit seeking and not-for-profit organizations. We then review the implication of these decisions for performance."
