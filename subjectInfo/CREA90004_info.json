        "This subject will provide students with a simulated placement opportunity for extended observation of and participation in a creative arts therapies program as practiced by a qualified professional.",
        "Students will learn to integrate relevant psychological and behavioural theory into a particular practice context in response to the needs of people in that context. They will learn how to consider ethical issues and practice ethically, with particular reference to standards of practice. They will also develop an understanding of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams and be able to understand their own role in different professional contexts.",

        "Simulated Placement",
        "Students are required to complete a simulated practice placement (160 accreditation hours) and will work across a range of tasks in collaboration with qualified professionals and the subject coordinator."
