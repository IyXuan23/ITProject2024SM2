    "overview": [
        "Urban soils can present distinct and unique challenges to the land manager, landscape architect or horticulturist responsible for developing, maintaining or improving urban landscapes. Often compacted, contaminated, or otherwise unsuitable for plant growth, urban soils require assessment, solutions and practical methods to ensure successful outcomes. This applications-oriented subject covers several fundamental soil science issues with direct relevance to urban landscape impacts, uses and requirements. Topics covered include compaction, nutrition, contamination, water supply, drainage and structural soils."

        "Discuss hydrological issues associated with soil water availability, irrigation supply and drainage management; and",
        "Discuss ecosystem services that urban soils provide to the population, built landscape and biodiversity."
