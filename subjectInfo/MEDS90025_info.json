    "overview": [
        "This capstone subject draws together students\u2019 learning in the context of contemporary health care delivery and prepares students for their next phases of medical training (prevocational and vocational). This will be achieved in three 4-week clinical placements and two weeks of face-to-face teaching and learning, as well as a series of small-group tutorials and online learning sessions.",
        "1. \u2018Preparation for Practice\u2019 connects students\u2019 prior learning throughout the MD program to the delivery of safe and effective practice. This will be achieved with a variety of approaches including simulation, small group tutorials and practical sessions. Some of the \u2018Preparation for Practice\u2019 content will occur during the allocated fortnight of face-to-face teaching, with the rest to take place as online learning sessions or tutorials throughout the remainder of Transition to Practice.",
        "2. Students will rotate through three 4-week clinical placement terms:",
        "a. Two \u2018Trainee Intern\u2019 terms provide students with opportunities to rehearse the role of an intern in a hospital-based medical or surgical unit. Students will be supported to reflect on their experiences within this term to allow a smooth and less stressful transition to internship.",
        "b. A \u2018Trainee Intern Selective\u2019 term allows students to select a specific medical discipline for more in-depth experience working with an individual clinician or medical team.",
        "The subject culminates in a leadership course at the end of their final rotation."
