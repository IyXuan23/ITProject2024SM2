        "Foundations of Electrical Networks develops an understanding of fundamental modelling techniques for the analysis of systems that involve electrical phenomena. This includes networks models of \u201cflow-drop\u201d one-port elements in steady state (DC and AC), electrical power systems, simple RC and RL transient analysis, and networks involving ideal and non-ideal operational amplifiers.It forms the foundation of many engineering subjects exploring fundamental concepts in electrical and electronic engineering.The subject will cover key electrical engineering topics in the areas of:Electrical phenomena \u2013 charge, current, electrical potential, conservation of energy and charge, the generation, storage, transport and dissipation of electrical power.Network models \u2013 networks of \u201cflow-drop\u201d one-port elements, Kirchoff\u2019s laws, standard current-voltage models for one-ports (independent sources, resistors, capacitors, inductors, transducers, diodes), analysis of static networks, properties of linear time-invariant (LTI) one-ports and impedance functions, diodes, transformers, steady-state (DC and AC) analysis of LTI networks via mesh and node techniques, equivalent circuits, and transient analysis of simple circuits;Electrical power systems \u2013 overview of power generation and transmission, analysis of single-phase and balanced three-phase AC power systems.",
