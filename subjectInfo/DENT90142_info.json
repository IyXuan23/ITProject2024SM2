Topics integrated within this subject include cultural safety for Aboriginal and Torres Islander people and communities, digital health, sustainability, ethical practice, and person-centred care. Students will develop skills in critical reflection and evidence-based dentistry as they examine the impact of oral health and disease on individuals, communities, and the environment."
