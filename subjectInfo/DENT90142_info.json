        "This subject supports students as they begin to develop their professional identity as dental practitioners through the development of their personal values, attitudes, and behaviours. This subject will focus on social responsibility and professionalism, communication and leadership, critical thinking, and health promotion. Topics integrated within this subject include cultural safety for Aboriginal and Torres Islander people and communities, digital health, sustainability, ethical practice, and person-centred care. Students will develop skills in critical reflection and evidence-based dentistry as they examine the impact of oral health and disease on individuals, communities, and the environment."
