        "This subject is available only to students who are Members ofMelbourne Journal of International Law (MJIL)and are committed to a position involving a substantial intellectual contribution toMJILduring the enrolled semester. The nature of the 'substantial intellectual contribution' required of students will vary depending on the nature of their work withMJIL. It will typically involve, at a minimum, taking responsibility for the sub-editing of material accepted for publication, such editing to be typically done in respect of at least one lengthy article (in excess of 10,000 words in length) or multiple shorter articles (each under 10,000 words in length). The contribution of students holding Editorial positions may be in the form of strategic editorial control and decision making.",
        "Making a 'substantial intellectual contribution' is a hurdle requirement for the subject, which permits students to provide evidence of what the student has learnt about the nature of international legal research from undertaking their tasks withinMJIL. This evidence takes the form of the writing tasks specified below, requiring engagement with international legal scholarship as well as critical reflection on work undertaken."
