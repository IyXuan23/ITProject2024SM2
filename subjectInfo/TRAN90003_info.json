        "Students will be trained in specialised fields of English-Chinese translation in this subject. They will choose to work in two of the following specialisations: business & commerce, journalistic writing; public & government; political speeches; and literary writing. Through lectures and discussions, students will develop understanding of skills and techniques required for specialised translation. Students will complete translation assignments regularly throughout the semester and be given regular individual feedback from the coordinator using online tools. Through practical translation tasks and practice activities, students will familiarise themselves with genre-specific linguistic features of the source and target languages, and develop professional translation skills in the chosen specialisation areas."
