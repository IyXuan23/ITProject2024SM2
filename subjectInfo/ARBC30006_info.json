    "overview": [
        "In this subject students will engage with Arabic language and culture at an advanced level, through close study of Arabic stylistic and rhetorical devices as well as of the finer details of Arabic syntax. In the process, they will be reading literary and historic texts, critical articles, book excerpts and evaluative and argumentative essays of substantial length and academic standards, pertaining to Arabic literature, Arab culture, history and political economy. They will also enjoy reading some examples of Arabic popular literature. Reading activities will be supported and supplemented by opportunities to listen to recorded presentations of greater complexity and length by Arab intellectuals and literati and conduct small-scale research for writing essays.",
        "Students will enjoy intensive language practice to help develop their discourse (both written and spoken) to produce carefully constructed argumentative and evaluative essays and oral presentations of their own. Apart from Modern Standard Arabic, students will be exposed to Classical Arabic prose as well as modern idiomatic and conversational forms, learning to follow extended discourse on complex and/or abstract topics, including some non-standard language."
