        "This subject will\u202fintroduce\u202fyou to\u202fthe natural history of Australia from the Cretaceous to the present\u202fand the influence of Australia's First Peoples and\u202fEuropeans\u202fon Australia\u2019s environments.\u202fYou will explore the major biomes and climatic zones\u202fthat have existed across the continent in the past, and\u202fthe influence of climate change on\u202ftheir\u202fpresent and future distributions.\u202fYou will learn of\u202fthe\u202fincredible diversity of Australian flora and fauna both on land and in aquatic environments, and consider the biological challenges, adaptations and evolutionary journeys that have led to our current species diversity. This will include Australia's familiar and our more elusive inhabitants - from eucalypts and kangaroos to velvet worms and orchids.\u202fThroughout, you will learn of the conservation successes and failures and how we protect our precious flora and fauna for the future. This subject will require you to observe,\u202frecord,\u202fand reflect on the\u202fdiversity of the\u202fnatural world, and complete self-guided field trips with your peers within the Melbourne\u202fmetropolitan region."
