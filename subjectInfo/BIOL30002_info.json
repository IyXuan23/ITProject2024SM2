        "This subject will provide students with the opportunity to gain a first-hand laboratory experience of the structure and function of critical endocrine and neuroendocrine systems, including the reproductive system, and how environmental factors can affect an animal\u2019s physiology. Students will gain experience in experimental design, cutting-edge research techniques, data analysis, and scientific report writing and will be introduced to the practicalities of conducting a 5-week project in a research laboratory.",
        "This subject gives students of science and biomedical science a solid foundation in laboratory practice in experimental animal biology. Students will be provided with an opportunity to engage in an authentic experience of scientific research: addressing questions in animal physiology to generate a hypothesis; designing an experiment; hands-on experience in the use of experimental animals; working in a group to complete the experiments and to collect and analyse the data; writing up an individual final report in the format of a scientific manuscript; and peer-review."
