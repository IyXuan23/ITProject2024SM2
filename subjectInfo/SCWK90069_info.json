    "overview": [
        "The aim of the subject is to familiarise students with a range of approaches useful for researching social work practice. In this subject \u201cpractice\u201d is defined broadly to encompass policy and organisational practice as well as practice with individuals, groups and communities.Social work research methods are used in all aspects of social work practice from describing and attempting to understand the issues with which, and the people with whom we work, to establishing the effectiveness of what we do. There is increasingly an emphasis on evidence-based practice, which necessitates an ability to evaluate and use research evidence to inform practice. Social workers move in increasing numbers and earlier in their careers into roles requiring them to initiate as well as participate in practice based research. The organisations in which social workers work are increasingly promoting a culture of practice research in an attempt to plan and evaluate service delivery in a reflective and thoughtful way.The lectures and seminars will present a range of practice research issues, broadly mirroring the research process in the field. They will also offer examples and identify opportunities for practice research and the challenges confronting practitioners in undertaking it."
