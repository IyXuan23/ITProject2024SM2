        "This subject develops familiarity with technical and administrative aspects of health information science \u2013 when, why and how health data can be generated, collected, stored, communicated and integrated to inform patient care, health research and health services management. It provides an overview of the knowledge and tools that are essential for managing and governing digital patient record data for primary and secondary uses.",
        "Lectures and tutorials cover four major topics: (a) Structuring health data in the era of big data in healthcare; (b) Managing and governing electronic health and medical records for safety and quality of care, including: standards, terminologies and mapping approaches applicable to clinical data and clinical documentation; (c) Structural and semantic interoperability to support data use for connected care and population health, including: Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR); (d) Managing and governing secondary use of data, including health services administration and health research, including: approaches to data privacy and security, repositories, retrieval, quality assessment, and linkage."
