    "overview": [
        "Exploring Numbers and Reasoning is designed for students requiring mathematical skills to provide a foundation for further academic studies. This subject covers basic mathematical and numeracy concepts in the context of academic reasoning and argument. Students will be introduced to a range of mathematical topics including basic calculations, algebra, linear equations, graphs, statistical and financial functions.",
        "The subject will draw on content covered in the other subjects offered as part of the DiGS Extended program to provide practical and real-life examples to utilise and reinforce mathematical concepts presented as part of the subject."
