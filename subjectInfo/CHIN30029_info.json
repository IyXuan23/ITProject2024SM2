    "overview": [
        "This subject is the Capstone subject in the Chinese Studies major of the Bachelor of Arts. It explores the relationship between traditional culture and modern life in Chinese societies using original Chinese language materials, supplemented by academic writing in English on Chinese society and culture.",
        "The subject is designed to give students majoring in Chinese Studies the opportunity to consolidate, integrate and extend their knowledge of the Chinese language, and of Chinese culture and society; it will serve as a bridge between the undergraduate experience and future study or work. Students are expected to build up advanced Chinese language skills and cultural knowledge through engagement with Chinese texts, to equip them to be active participants in Chinese cultural settings by focusing on how Chinese people conceive of the relationship between Chinese traditions (defined in different ways) and the structures of modern life (including modern political and economic systems, modern ideas about social relations and modern forms of culture)."
