The principles and practices of mental health presentations are reviewed as discussion focuses on deepening understanding of the National Mental Health Plan, major psychiatric disorders, mental health law, psychiatric nursing assessment, collaborative care models, and service providers. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of psychotropic medication and issues related to medication management for people experiencing mental health issues will be explored.",
        "During theprofessional experience placementunder the guidance of clinical educators/ preceptors, students will participate in collaborative, inter-professional mental health care. They will gain experience in acute, sub acute or community mental health/psychiatric services that will enable them to combine general nursing expertise with beginning skills in mental health assessment and care.",
        "The major focus for the clinical practicum component of this subject is the integration of the principles of mental health nursing and clinical decision making. On completion of the subject it is expected that students, while providing therapeutic interventions, are able to incorporate the further collection of health assessment data and adjust care accordingly for 1-2 patients."
