        "Contemporary software systems such as search engines must deal with huge amounts of data, often in real time. In such cases, standard data structures and algorithms do not scale. This subject aims to provide an overview of contemporary advanced algorithms and data structures in computer science for such problems. These techniques serve as building blocks for solving complex algorithmic problems, and have many practical applications."
