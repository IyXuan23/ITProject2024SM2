        "Building on the knowledge acquired in Music Language 1, Music Language 2 continues with a survey of chromatic harmony, select thematic and contrapuntal devices, and form, up to the beginnings of the dissolution of functional harmony in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
        "Students will be expected to demonstrate their understanding of voice leading and harmonic function through regular assignments which will include analysis, chord construction, the writing of two-part contrapuntal textures and four-part chromatic harmonic textures (Bach-style chorales)."
