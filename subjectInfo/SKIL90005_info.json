        "This subject allows graduate researchers to undertake a 3 to 6-month (full-time equivalent) research and development (R&D) internship with a host organisation (industry partner) in an area broadly related to their area of research. An internship is related to their area of research if it makes use of or contributes to their research skills or their discipline knowledge. Graduate researchers will undertake a defined research project within the host organisation and/ or participate in team-based R&D, while also being exposed to the broader operational contexts of the organisation or industry.",
        "The internship will provide graduate researchers with the opportunity to apply their research skills and capacity in an organisational context, to gain practical experience and increase their discipline knowledge, and build professional networks to enhance their career options. Graduate researchers will have the opportunity to further develop their employability skills including communication, interpersonal, analytical, problem-solving, organisational, project-management and time-management skills, and to contextualise their research area within industry concerns and needs.",
        "Enrolment in this subject requires approval to participate in the internship program, including approval by the Graduate Research Internships team and the graduate researcher's principal supervisor. Graduate researchers will be required to sign a student deed, which may include a confidentiality agreement and/or assign ownership of intellectual property generated during the internship to the host organisation."
