    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to principles, technologies and procedures used for sensing and measurement of different physical environments and explore how the collected information supports decision making in various applications. This subject explains the theoretical and practical aspects of mapping the physical world to a digital representation. Students will learn the concept of a digital twin, the role of sensing and measuring for connecting the physical world with its digital representations, and exemplary applications of sensing and measuring in the domain of infrastructure engineering. The practical sessions will give hands-on experience with a range of sensing and measurement technologies in a problem-solving context. Students who develop proficiency in the practice of this subject will be able to apply this knowledge in the workplace for capturing and sensing the environment.",
        "The subject content is based on the fundamental insight that, since no exact measurement exists, we always observe phenomena with uncertainty. Error theory and concepts of sensing and measurement are discussed and accompanied by computations such as levelling, traversing, IoT, positioning, deformation monitoring, map projections and the shape of the Earth, data capturing, map preparation and incorporation of field surveys into drafting, modelling applications, and Digital Twins. The fieldwork will make arrangements for on-campus and online students.",
