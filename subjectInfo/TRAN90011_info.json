    "overview": [
        "Students experiment with the main variables of translation and interpreting  processes, including directionality, speed, documentation and revision, in order to develop their own efficiency and quality control. Translation and interpreting technologies, pre-editing, post-editing and terminology management are incorporated into the process, as are the basics of project management.  Through seminars, class activities and readings, students gain insight into the central issues in process-based translation and interpreting studies. The focus is on building the performance skills required for the successful production of translations and interpreting renditions."
