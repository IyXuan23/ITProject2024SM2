    "overview": [
        "In this subject students will explore and understand the ideas that shape practice-based research in the contemporary arts education through the examination of practice and evaluation as artmaker and practitioner. Educators from a range of educational settings will engage in personal artful inquiry to develop a body of work as a method for exploring the identities and practices of artist, researcher, teacher and artist-teacher. These multiple perspectives and identities will be evaluated through ongoing reflective practice, collaborative discussion and associated readings in practice based research that explore beliefs concerning the relationship and associated tensions of being artmaker and being teacher. Artistry, artful inquiry and associated personal dialogue, will be documented, critiqued and analysed through critical reflective practice, and evaluated in an iterative cycle both within the class and through regular contributions to a discussion forum.  Students will present and perform arts based research, and submit an accompanying exegesis that positions their practice in educational settings."
