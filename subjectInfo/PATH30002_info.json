    "overview": [
        "PATH30002 Techniques for Investigation of Disease is the capstone subject for the Pathology Major and consolidates the principles and concepts introduced in PATH30001. These laboratory-based classes aim to develop an authentic practical and theoretical understanding of the modern scientific investigation of disease.",
        "Techniques used will include histopathology, macroscopic analysis, bioinformatic approaches, molecular pathology and critical analysis of published research papers. Comparisons will be made between normal and abnormal tissues, organs and functions in the context of tissue regeneration and repair, acute and chronic inflammation, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Diseases to be examined include major conditions affecting society.",
        "This course will introduce students to basic principles of laboratory based analytical methods that are currently used in Biomedical Research and Diagnostic and Forensic Pathology laboratories."
