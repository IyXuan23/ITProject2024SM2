        "Students will learn the theoretical underpinnings of environmental education through a study of the concept of environmentalism. The subject will combine an introduction to theory and practice in the field of environmental education. A particular focus will be on different understandings of nature and the environment and the implications of these for education. This will include the role that science has played and continues to play in our understanding of both the environment and education. The subject will provide students with some of the important strategies for the development of environmental education in a variety of sectors. It will also provide ideas for educational activities. In addition, the subject will deal with ways of actualising individuals or groups who wish to learn how to become involved in action for the environment and social change."
