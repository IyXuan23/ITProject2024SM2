        "This subject examines ways in which children (birth to Year 6), childhoods, their families, and communities are constructed in Australian communities and society. This subject will highlight teachers\u2019 professional responsibilities towards children, their families and the community. The focus of this subject is on investigating a strengths-based image of the child, their families, and their communities. Topics include historical and contemporary constructions of the child and childhoods, working with families, equity, inclusion, diversity, policy, curriculum frameworks, ethics, contemporary theories and perspectives, transitions, advocacy, reciprocal relationships with families and communities and professional roles and responsibilities.",
        "The placement component will provide Teacher Candidates with the opportunity to synthesise their learning gained throughout the course with a focus on children, childhood and families. Additionally, Teacher Candidates will have the opportunity of demonstrating their understanding of the characteristics of professional knowledge, clinical praxis and engagement for professional accountability in an early childhood setting. Teacher Candidates will reflect critically on the ways in which educational theory and research informs practice.",
        "This subject includes a Clinical Teaching Practicum (Placement) in an Early Childhood setting. During the placement, Teacher Candidates will demonstrate the nexus between theory and the practice of teaching, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research to support their teaching practice. Teacher Candidates are supported by experienced Clinical Specialists and Mentor Teachers. A series of seminars will be held which explore Candidates\u2019 developing professional knowledge, practice and engagement."
