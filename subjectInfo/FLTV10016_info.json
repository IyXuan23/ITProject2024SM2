        "This subject is an introduction to a broad suite of concepts and techniques that will develop awareness and skills in the fundamental principles of animation production.",
        "Students will be given creative problems to solve through experimentation with each animation technique such as stop-motion and 2D and will utilise different methods such as straight-ahead and key-frame animation.",
        "Students will also undertake exercises in drawing, audio recording and will be introduced to animation software."
