    "overview": [
        "This subject is designed to provide current insight and exposure into key issues, challenges and logistical matters that face the food industry in the area of innovation and improvement design. Innovation may be, but is not limited to, new product development, marketing, consumer insights, research, packaging design and process technology. Through attending industry workshops and the internship program students will experience 'real-life' situations that are associated with food innovation, the key components driving innovation in this industry and major hurdles that need to be addressed. Students will gain an appreciation of the processes and constraints behind innovation and how resources can be managed to drive the process of change. This internship is not designed to be \u201cwork-experience\u201d, but rather allows students to understand the decision making process and practical application while working in a project of relevance to the company they are based in. This experience aims to provide students a holistic experience in which the need for networking, collaboration and team-work are highlighted while allowing them the opportunity to develop their own identity so that they can decide how best they can market themselves in a dynamic, non-linear, innovative food industry.",
