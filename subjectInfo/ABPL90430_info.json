    "overview": [
        "Design with Country: Resilience Studio offers students unique opportunities to engage in landscape and architecture on an Indigenous co-led design project focused on climate-resilient designs. Through the design studio, students will explore sustainable urbanism, regional park connectivity, public and hybrid public-private facilities, health-related design, access and recreation.  Indigenous participation occurs throughout the semester and will be coupled with a focus on the past, present and future of the site, design for seasons, and layers of Country. This investigation will coincide with expert presentations on hydrology, landscape ecology and biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",
        "The studio involves real-world collaboration, with students developing visions and design proposals for specific areas of the Ballerrt Mooroop site in collaboration with members of the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Council (WWCHAC) and Merri-Bek Council and working group. Emphasis is placed on landscape ecology and urban design, alongside careful site designs embedding cultural awareness and integrating Indigenous knowledge. Students will engage with city managers, Traditional Owners, stakeholders, and design professionals to address challenges and opportunities. The studio aligns with the Birrarung Council's concept of bi-cultural environmental net gain, emphasizing co-design with Traditional Owners",
        "The course begins with educational immersion, fostering professional relationships and cultural intelligence. Students will explore the history, context, and perspectives of Country and custodianship. As the course progresses, students will focus on Merri-Bek Council\u2019s climate adaptation and resilience for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2100 through a cultural, ecological, infrastructural and land use change lens (e.g. commercial, residential and recreational). Students will concurrently develop an intimate knowledge of Ballerrt Mooroop and work on site design projects that like long term resilience for Council with landscape architecture strategies for the site and surrounding area. The work will be on behalf of the WWCHAC (Rights Holders) and Merri-Bek Council to contribute to a larger effort to activate and develop the site as an Indigenous Community Hub.",
        "Historically, the course originated from an invitation by the Birrarung Council in 2021 to collaborate on Indigenous design ideas and resiliency planning along the Birrarung river. Over three years, the studio addressed needs along the living riverine corridor and established a co-education model with the WWCHAC Education Group. This year, the studio relocated to a new site at the request of the WWCHAC Board.",
