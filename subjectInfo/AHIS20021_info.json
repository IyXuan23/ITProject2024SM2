    "overview": [
        "This subject will introduce students to the mediums, genres, and vocabulary of pre-modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean visual culture. Weekly lectures and tutorials will focus on either a specific medium (ink painting, calligraphy, ceramics, timber frame architecture, urban landscape, gardens) or a theme (tombs, Buddhism, Confucianism, genre painting, narrative painting) and through case studies, the political, social, and cultural factors that inform and shape works of art will be considered.",
        "The objects and sites under consideration will sometimes raise historical questions about the impact of one tradition upon the others, allowing us to see East Asia as a culturally connected macroregion; in other cases, the lectures will bring together works that require us to think critically about how we analyse and interpret the history of artistic production. Ultimately, this subject will provide students a foundation and framework to consider the history of East Asian art, as well as the tools by which to consider the dimensions and character of the common narratives applied to this history."

        "Consider the arts of China, Japan, and Korea within their individual cultural contexts, as well as within the broader contexts of intra- and interregional exchange",
        "Develop the foundational skills of visual, material, and iconographic analysis necessary to analyse East Asian art and pre-modern art more generally & understand the limitations of these foundational skills and to consider alternative methods and approaches to understanding the history of East Asian art."
