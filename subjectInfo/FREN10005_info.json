    "overview": [
        "This subject offers students who have completed French 1, or equivalent, an increasing immersion into the study of the French language and of French-speaking cultures throughout the world. Students will develop further autonomy in their study of more sophisticated grammatical structures of the language and in their interpretation of the cultural reference of authentic texts. These documents will be of greater complexity in relation to the previous semester\u2019s work and will include written texts and audio-visual material such as songs and a feature film. Reading, speaking and writing skills will be developed through the interpretation of authentic texts in French. Oral communication skills will be further enhanced through more sophisticated listening comprehension and pronunciation exercises as well as in-class oral presentations based on projects and discussion of the material studied in class"
