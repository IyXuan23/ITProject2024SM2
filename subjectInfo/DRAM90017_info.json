    "overview": [
        "The Independent Project is a major practice and research subject, drawing on and applying the knowledge and skills of directing gained throughout the course.",
        "Through discussions in advance of the subject, each student will identify a performance project they will direct. This could be a solo performance they devise and perform themselves, the direction of a single-authored text, or anything in-between.",
        "The performance outcome can take place on campus with undergraduate actors, for a season of graduate work at La Mama, for a company that engages you to direct for them, or for an independent production.",
        "The practice \u2013 direction of a piece of performance \u2013 forms a major part of a critical research project with a written dissertation and the two parts will be supervised by a member of Theatre staff.",
        "It is possible that the entire project could be written (rather than practice-led).",
        "It is possible that the production might take place outside of Melbourne, provided that appropriate supervision and assessment can be ensured.",
        "The student is asked to set up a research question to investigate and analyse through creative practice and through the identification and application of appropriate critical and theoretical frameworks. Supervision will take place throughout the project.",
        "The assessment structure is devised to allow students to create their research proposal, pursue that research in the relevant practical context and then present their findings in the following assessments on campus at the end of the project: individual documentation (journal and/or multimedia), a class presentation and critical analysis in a final essay."
