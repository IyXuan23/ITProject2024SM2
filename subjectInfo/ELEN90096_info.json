    "overview": [
        "Hardware acceleration for computationally intensive applications is of growing importance for improving workload performance in cloud data centres, the network edge, and IoT embedded devices. This subject introduces students to the basics of hardware design for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) which are widely used to accelerate algorithms in applications areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, networking, cryptography, and multimedia signal processing. In addition to covering FPGA fundamentals, the subject will take a systems-based approach to analysing algorithms for suitability of acceleration and mapping to heterogeneous computing resources.",
