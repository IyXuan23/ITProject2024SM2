    "overview": [
        "This cluster/subject challenges students to design small scale architecture to a high degree of material resolution. This includes consideration of the tectonics \u2013 poetics of construction \u2013 and the whole of life environmental implications of material choices.",
        "A variety of independent studios will be offered for preferencing by ballot prior to the start of semester (O-week). Programmes will vary and may include civic, urban, housing, institutional, community or commercial typologies. Common to all studios will be small scale architecture resolved to a high degree of detail. A Seminar series and/or workshops and/or online modules will introduce students to design theories, design techniques and digital tools related to the design challenge(s).",
        "Through a process of careful investigation of materials, study of precedents, and application of contemporary design theories and techniques, students will be expected to develop architectural designs that use materials both poetically and resourcefully. Students will be expected to demonstrate the environmental and material competencies set out in the National Standards of Competency for Architects. Students will also be expected to communicate their design vision in a clear, detailed and professional manner, incorporating models and/or prototypes and/or material investigations as appropriate to their design."
