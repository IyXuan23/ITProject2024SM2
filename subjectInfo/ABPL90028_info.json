        "This subject provides a critical review of the theory of project management in construction by showing and reflecting on how the established set of project management competencies applies to all phases of building projects\u2019 life cycle. Through project simulations and structured discussion, students are made aware of the relationship between quantitative data and qualitative decisions in a framework of relative uncertainty, and how this relationship is likely to change depending on project type, technological context and building coalitions. By covering new developments, trends and technologies in project management, the subject exposes students to possible transformations in the discipline. At the end of the subject, students are required to go through a self-assessment process that helps them identify knowledge gaps and own development paths as well as the importance of peer interaction and reflective learning in team environments."
