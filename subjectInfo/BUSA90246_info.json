    "overview": [
        "To be successful, organisations need to recognise, create, grow, and protect market-based assets that influence demand. This subject focuses on the challenges organisations face in managing demand, and how to address those challenges with optimal demand-side strategies.  Students learn how brand equity, the existing customer base, and support from channels (e.g., intermediaries such as retailers) constitute the most important market-based assets, as these assets help produce market outcomes such as sales growth, price premiums, market share and customer retention and referral. Additionally, students learn how (and which) marketing investments help develop market-based assets, how market-based assets translate into market outcomes, and how market outcomes in turn help in ensuring the long-term survival and success of organisations."
