    "overview": [
        "Students will further consolidate their ability to communicate in German in oral and written discourse and develop cultural literacy in German by engaging with key themes in modern German-speaking societies. Topics include among others history and stories of migration, the concept of work through the ages or criticism of consumption. Students will develop more advanced language skills through reading short literary and journalistic texts and engaging with audio-visual and digital media. They will produce shorter texts of different types (eg. argumentative essays, reviews) and learn how to debate contemporary issues. Students will also gain an understanding of the principles of organising language as well as developing proficiency in the use of the appropriate linguistic tools for the formation of situation-appropriate vocabulary, sentence and text structures. Students will become familiar with specialised terminology and will develop analytical skills relevant to the topic area."
