        "This subject is designed for students with some previous knowledge of Ancient Greek (VCE level or equivalent) and who preferably have completed Ancient Greek 3. Students translate and discuss the interpretation of a selected work of Greek poetry (Homeric epic). In tutorials, further work is undertaken on grammar and syntax, revising and consolidating knowledge acquired in Ancient Greek 3. Students will also undertake work in Ancient Greek literary and textual criticism.",
        "On completion of this subject, students should have consolidated their skills in working with Ancient Greek texts and have discovered some of the many important contributions which reading the original texts can make to understanding the ancient world. Students who complete this subject and Ancient Greek 3 may progress to Ancient Greek 5.",
