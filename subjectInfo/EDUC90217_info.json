        "In this placement a range of experiences appropriate to the setting are designed by the Field Supervisor and Placement Coordinator. These include familiarisation to a professional practice setting through an induction process; independent experiences in individual client services - observation, assessment, interviewing and reporting; program implementation; increased access to professional issues - confidentiality, ethics, identity, networks; professional literature and research.",
        "During this placement students are required to conduct themselves in a professional manner with an appropriate degree of autonomy; undertake psycho-educational assessments independently and effectively report on their findings to a range of audiences; undertake small group discussions, interviews, programs and interventions with appropriate negotiation, documentation and evaluation and display sensitivity and skills in counselling, interviewing, problem solving, and consultation tasks. The placement provides the opportunity to carry out the tasks of an educational and developmental psychologist under supervision and in accordance with Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) professional competency standards. Opportunities to receive feedback are built into the task design.  There are a series of lectures covering issues of professional practice, ethics, case formulation skills, report writing, supervision, and contemporary issues in educational and developmental psychology practice."
