    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces Interns who are studying Humanities Learning Area or History Learning Area to additional research and practice in the teaching of Humanities and Social Sciences in the context of Australian/Victorian Curricula and Frameworks. This subject will deepen their understanding of the nature of Humanities education for all secondary school students (Years 7-12). This subject provides Interns with both the knowledge base and the skills of professional practice to enable them to effectively educate all school students in their specific learning areas and to work effectively within school contexts.",
        "Interns are supported to strengthen their knowledge of the conceptual foundations of disciplines in the Humanities and disciplinary skills related to best practice pedagogy and assessment, as well as the application and management of these activities in classrooms. Framed through the Clinical Teaching Model, they are supported to adapt and apply this knowledge in lesson planning, including the selection and integration of teaching strategies and resources, including the effective and appropriate use of ICT, to meet the specific needs of students from diverse backgrounds, and to engage students in their learning. This subject develops the foundations for Interns to prepare them to effectively educate senior secondary school students (VCE) in one Humanities subject.",
        "The assessment tasks in this subject provide a pathway for the development of Interns understanding of contemporary research in disciplines in the Humanities and its relationship with content and pedagogical knowledge, along with specific skills in developing, sequencing and delivering programs."
