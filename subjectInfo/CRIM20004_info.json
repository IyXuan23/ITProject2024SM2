    "overview": [
        "This subject invites students to look anew at things we, as individuals and society, often take for granted, by analysing the nature of social order and how it inevitably creates non-conformity and deviance. This subject will help students to (a) explore what crime and deviance mean within a society that is often riven with civil conflicts and to (b) discover how does society hang together \u2013 and at what cost and whose expense.",
        "To do so, we will explore classical and contemporary sociological and criminological theories that help to explain the nature of social order and crime and deviance. To enhance students\u2019 analytical skills, each theory will be examined through grounded examples, as diverse as terrorism, witch hunts, religious cults, and industrial disasters, as well as current events in Australia and beyond. The application of theory to real-life cases will help students to determine theories\u2019 strengths and limitations, and ultimately their value in understanding the diversity of human behaviour and social reactions to it, whilst developing a critical stance on how we as society define and deal with crime, deviance, order, and disorder."

        "Explain and apply main sociological and criminological theoretical approaches",
        "Evaluate, compare, and contrast the propositions of these theoretical approaches and determine their relevance to specific real-life situations, whilst appreciating the diversity and dynamics of social contexts of increasingly heterogeneous, globalising world",
        "Describe how individual experiences, behaviours, and social positions influence and are influenced by the broader social environment",
        "Articulate and discuss in oral and written forms their own interpretations of real-life phenomena (e.g. 'social problems'), current events, and public debates, using various theoretical approaches to support and communicate effectively own arguments",
        "By drawing on and applying main socio-criminological theoretical approaches, analyse and critique social order and the way the state deems some behaviours and certain populations as 'criminal' or 'deviant'."
