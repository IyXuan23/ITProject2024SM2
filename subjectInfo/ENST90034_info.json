    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on climate change adaptation, and in particular its environmental, political, social and policy dimensions. It explores the ways which climate change poses risks to human wellbeing, and the ways these risks can be managed. It draws on examples from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region, and in particular from the teaching staff\u2019s concurrent research on climate change adaptation in small islands. The explains that adaptation and its success can be thought of and approached in multiple ways, shaped in part by existing interests and the varied and dynamic places in which adaptation is being consciously or unconsciously implemented. The subject also highlights that adaptation poses as well as addresses risks, and that decisions about adaptation need to be considered critically and iteratively. The subject is taught in an intensive mode. Topics include:",
        "Issues of complexity, uncertainty, knowledge, power, and practice in researching and implementing climate change",
        "The relationship between adaptation and other processes of change, including development",
        "Strategies for change at global, regional, local and individual scales, their inter-relations and how they may be facilitated."
