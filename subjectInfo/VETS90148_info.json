    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on both the general principles of veterinary production animal practice and the specific approach to diagnosis, control and prevention of disease in production animals, with a focus on public health. Content will be delivered in blocks based on clinical presentations related to gastrointestinal, urinary, nervous and non-specific clinical problems in parallel with presentations of the same systems in other species. This approach is designed to support students in the development of their diagnostic reasoning skills, and encourage a comparative view of veterinary medicine and surgery."

    "intended learning outcomes": [
        "Perform a safe clinical examination, collect and interpret clinical history, epidemiological data and physical examination findings in an individual or herds of ruminants and camelids in order to develop contextually appropriate prioritised differential diagnoses related to gastrointestinal, urinary, nervous and non-specific clinical presentations",
        "Analyse records of production, health and reproductive performance in populations of ruminants and camelids in order to make recommendations that optimise health and productivity",
        "Justify and perform appropriate ancillary laboratory tests and interpret the results of the laboratory reports in order to establish a definitive diagnosis of diseases and production-limiting conditions that affect ruminants and camelids",
        "Formulate and recommend appropriate therapeutic and control strategies for important endemic and exotic diseases of individuals or herds of ruminants and camelids to achieve farm financial, animal health and production performance targets (taking into account the legal, ethical, prognostic, economic, welfare, public health and food safety considerations)"
