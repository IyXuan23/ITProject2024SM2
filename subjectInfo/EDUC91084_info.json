    "overview": [
        "This subject further develops Teacher Candidates\u2019 mathematical content knowledge and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge for effective teaching and learning of Mathematics in Victorian Primary Schools. The content focus is Measurement and Geometry using the four proficiency strands from the Australian/Victorian Curricula. Teacher Candidates will analyse the development of key concepts in Measurement and Geometry. Within this strand, Teacher Candidates will analyse the development of key concepts in primary mathematics and identify critical progression points for children\u2019s learning. They will consider typical conceptions and misconceptions held by children, their likely causes, diagnostic tools to diagnose them and teaching strategies for changing them.",
        "Teacher Candidates will consider research evidence related to selected key issues of teaching Measurement and Geometry and examine tasks designed to achieve specific learning outcomes in this strand. They will examine cognitive and affective characteristics of mathematics classrooms that encourage deep learning in these content areas and understanding of the four proficiencies will be consolidated. Teacher Candidates will reference Victorian and Australian curriculum documents and resources when planning sequenced lessons. They will explore important pedagogical issues including the selection of good examples, use of non-examples, and representations of mathematical concepts. Teacher Candidates will explore how to apply models to differentiate in the mathematics classroom and engage in the Clinical Teaching Model to target teaching to groups of students."
