    "aims": [
        "This subject involves a major design project that concentrates on functional design of a piece of civil infrastructure such as a railway station, airport, school, sports stadium, or shopping centre. The design would have scope for structural and geotechnical solutions, innovative energy and water supplies, transport modelling, and project management and would be based on a broad conceptual design proposal that has been given to the design team. The design proposal will be presented at a functional level where the broad specifications of the design and how it might be constructed are generated and evaluated, rather than detailed specifications required for construction."
