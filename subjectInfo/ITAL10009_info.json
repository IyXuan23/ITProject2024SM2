        "This subject focuses on the spoken and written language and culture of present day Italy. Students will undertake regular activities in order to improve their linguistic and cultural skills. They will also participate in regular conversation practice for the purpose of reinforcing their command of current idiomatic Italian. Students will explore aspects of contemporary Italian culture and language, through a critical analysis of a variety of texts and documents (including films, music, mass media and literature). By the end of the subject, students should have improved their written production skills and should be able to express themselves with fluency on most topics of a general nature."

Upon completion of the placement test, students will receive an email with the outcome and entry point. Within 5 working days of receiving the email, study plans will be updated and students will be able to self-enrol into the first subject of their entry point. The results of the test are binding and enrolment can only be changed with approval from the coordinator of the language major.",
