        "Statistical genomicsis the application of statistical methods to understand genomes, their structure and function in many different scientific contexts, including: understanding biological mechanisms in health and disease  and predicting outcomes. The course will also cover common statistical methods used to analyse whole-genome sequencing-based modern biological data, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and single-cell transcriptomics, as well as their application to population data to study causes  of disease."
