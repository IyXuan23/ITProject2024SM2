    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces the basic principles, analysis, and design of communication networks. It covers relevant analytical methods, the layered network architecture of the Internet, and a multitude of network protocols.",
        "Analytical tools from queueing, optimisation, and graph theories are used to develop an in-depth understanding of basic principles and the role they play in network design. Specifically, queueing and graph theories are emphasised as methodological frameworks for communication network delay and structure analysis.",
        "The concepts taught in this subject lead to a better understanding of the Internet as well as modern communication paradigms such as Software-Defined Networks, Machine-to-Machine communication, Internet of Things, and social networks.",
        "Topics covered may include:",
        "The layered network architecture with a focus on physical-layer multiple access (TDM, FDM, WDM), link layer protocols and medium access control (MAC), network layer topologies, least-cost routing algorithms and protocols, transport layer protocols and the principles and techniques of practical reliable transport;",
        "LAN protocols, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and serial communications;",
        "The Internet's network layer including the Internet Protocol (IP) and routing protocols including an introduction to BGP and the operation of forwarding tables in routers and shortest prefix routing;",
        "The Internet's transport layer protocols UDP and TCP, including the flow and congestion control algorithms;",
        "Network security, application layer, cloud and fog computing, Machine-to-Machine communication, and Internet of Things;",
        "Queuing theory: basics, birth-death processes, M/M/x and Markovian queues, networks of queues;",
        "Basics of graph theory and social network analysis relevant to communication networks."
