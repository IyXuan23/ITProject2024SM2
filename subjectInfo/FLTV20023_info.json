        "Students are introduced to the responsibilities of the Producer, Showrunner, Line Producer, Executive Producer and other associated roles of the screenwriting and production departments. Detailed practical exercises in designing development, budgeting and casting documents will give students a solid grounding in managing screen projects from their initial development phase through to the raising of finance.",
