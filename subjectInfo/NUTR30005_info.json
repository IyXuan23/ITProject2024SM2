    "overview": [
        "The subject will focus on nutritional biochemistry and genomics and will examine how our genes and their corresponding proteins and enzymes connect with nutrition. Emphasis will be placed on the connection to human health.",
        "Students will explore the biochemical mechanisms behind the individual response to nutrients and dietary patterns and their implication to a personalised approach to nutrition. More specifically this subject will explore I) the relationships between genetics and diet, II) the impact on human health of enzymes disrupted function resulting from gene variants and mutations, III) the role of diet in affecting chemical modifications of DNA and histones that constitute the epigenome and, VI) the challenges of translating the fast-accumulating evidence in nutrition."
