        "This subject introduces students to the theories and methods used to understand people and settings for designing technical systems. The subject will equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to gather information about people and activities, to understand the intended users of the systems, and to use the insights gained from this process to identify design requirements. This subject is for students interested in a career in user experience (UX) design, interaction design, service design, usability engineering, and human-computer interaction research. It will be of value to students aiming to work in all areas of information technology development and implementation."
