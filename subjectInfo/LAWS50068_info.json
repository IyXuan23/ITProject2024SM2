    "overview": [
        "This subject examines the development, operation and future of anti-discrimination laws in Australia. In the absence of constitutional protection for equality in Australia, this is the major method of protecting people with specific attributes from discrimination. The course examines the capacities and limitations of law in trying to change broad social behaviour patterns in wide ranging areas of activity such as work, education, and supply of goods, services and accommodation. The introduction to the subject includes consideration of the ideas of equality and discrimination, and theories about their causes and remedies. Over time, emphasis has moved from a focus on discrimination to the underlying aim of promoting equality. The subject examines the opportunities and difficulties of operating within a federal system, critically analyses the effectiveness of anti-discrimination law in reducing inequality in Australia, and where relevant contrasts Australian law with other approaches. Current issues and reforms will be considered.",
        "The subject aims to develop expertise in the current legislative approaches and their development and a critical understanding of the historical and theoretical foundations of the law, and to evaluate its effect, including through international comparison. It considers how effective law has been in changing social practices and eliminating discrimination, and whether alternative approaches offer better prospects."
