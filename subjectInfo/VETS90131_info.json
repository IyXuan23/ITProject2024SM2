        "This subject introduces students to the study of parasitic infectious agents as causes of disease in animals. It includes the important features and life cycle considerations of common and important ectoparasites and strongyloid nematodes, the host-parasite interaction and the pathogenesis of disease, disease transmission and epidemiology, methods of diagnosis of parasitic disease as well as prevention, control and treatment."

        "Outline the broad groups of parasites that are common and important determinants of animal health, public health, production and welfare of domestic animals in Australia and internationally",
        "Identify clinical signs of common and important ectoparasitic and strongyloid nematode infections, and diagnose these parasites in host tissues using classical parasitological methods and molecular techniques",
        "Design adaptive, integrated parasite control programs for ectoparasitic and strongyloid nematode infections in domestic animals, taking into account parasitic life cycles, climate, ecology, epidemiology and chemical resistance against parasites",
        "Identify clinical signs, transmission potential and pathogens (ectoparasitic and strongyloid nematodes) associated with zoonotic and reportable diseases, and advise on appropriate reporting response and/or diagnosis, prevention and control"
