    "overview": [
        "This subject investigates how children learn language and literacy, as well as the critical importance of language to children\u2019s emergent literacy and successful learning. The content focuses on typical developmental progression and the evidence-based strategies to build rich language and literacy play-based programs in early childhood settings.",
        "This subject references the Australian/Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks and Curricula (VEYLDF). Teacher Candidates will be introduced to the VEYLDF Outcome 5: Children are Effective Communicators.",
        "Topics covered in this subject include adult interactions supporting infant communication and language development; family literacy and the home learning environment, including supporting multilingualism in a diverse language background; reading and writing development; evidence play-based pedagogies for language, reading and writing learning. Digital technologies as a tool to support language and literacy learning will be discussed. Indigenous perspectives will be woven into the topics to provide a meaningful approach to their incorporation in the curriculum. Teacher Candidates will be introduced to planning and designing language and literacy-rich learning environments as well as the assessment of language and literacy in the context of children\u2019s learning and development."
