    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on Audiology Practice A, with more aspects of the clinical encounter introduced so students learn to utilise multiple sources of information, use clinical reasoning skills to select the most appropriate audiological assessment and learn to provide management specific to the individual. On completion of the subject, students will be able to perform history taking and simple diagnostic audiological procedures, and establish appropriate management and intervention plans for straight forward scenarios. This subject will also continue to develop on clinical communication skills, with a focus on verbal and non-verbal skills."
