    "overview": [
        "This subject will focus on quantitative approaches to analyse business problems and based on these analyses, make effective decisions. The subject will explore descriptive analytic, predictive analytic, and prescriptive analytic techniques. Using these techniques, students will develop understanding of a wide variety of strategic and operational business decision problems being faced by managers and decision makers in the fields of financial management, human resource management, marketing management, operations management, and international business management. Students will be expected to be able to calculate and manipulate data as well as interpret the results in order to derive and evaluate alternative solutions to typical business decision problems."
