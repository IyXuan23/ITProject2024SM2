    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces sports medicine theory and practice, and explores the multi-faceted approach to managing the Modern Athlete. Relevant professional and sports medicine governance frameworks are consulted in a student-led evaluation of their own professional role and responsibilities in their current and potential practice contexts. There is opportunity to appraise self-knowledge and construct an individual learning plan to extend theory and practice in the context of managing the modern athlete. (This includes revising, applying or extending scientific knowledge and practice experience). Health advocacy in Sport and Exercise Medicine settings are appraised.",
        "The subject utilises a case-based approach to Modern Athlete-Centred Management. Case scenarios facilitate exploration of athletes\u2019 needs management options in different contexts. This includes consideration of special / defined populations, and challenges typical to the sports medicine environment that shape the clinical management plan. Embedded in the approach to managing the modern athlete is self-awareness of cognitive processes such as reasoning, decision-making, problem solving, goal setting; and the influence of evidence, innovation and ethics.",
        "Finally, experts\u2019 insights and students\u2019 shared examples of managing the modern athletes in specific scenarios will be integrated into understanding of the needs of the modern athlete. This provides context for comparing, contrasting, reflecting upon and extending both Modern Athlete-centred interdisciplinary management, and one\u2019s own development as a professional working in a sporting context."
