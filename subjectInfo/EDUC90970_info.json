    "overview": [
        "This subject provides an introduction to the guiding principles of effective teaching for learning in blended and online environments. It begins by reviewing the general principles of designing for learning, and then moves to the online context to consider what it means to become an online teacher and how the community of inquiry framework can be applied to develop teaching, cognitive and social presence. The subject continues with a critical analysis of the key elements of effective, student-centred approaches in blended and online learning environments, including the flipped classroom, the design and facilitation of learning tasks (i.e., inquiry projects, role-play simulations, peer collaboration), discussion board activities, feedback and assessment.",
        "",
        "The subject is evidence based, drawing on published research in the field, and also provides opportunities for participants to apply learnt skills by writing a proposal for, and creating a LMS mock-up of, a blended or fully online unit to use in their particular teaching and learning context. The subject is based around forming a Community of Inquiry (COI) exploring the Scholarship of Technology Enhanced Learning (SoTEL) to inform online learning design using a Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology."
