        "The purpose of the advanced coursework is to develop professional and scientific skills necessary for general scientific inquiry. The knowledge gained will foster the student\u2019s capacity to identify questions and generate ideas as well as providing a framework for students to use in order to approach and validate their ideas. Students will develop an understanding of experimental design, approach and evaluation, and skills in critical analysis of published experimental data. Students will also develop skills in written and oral forms of scientific communication."
