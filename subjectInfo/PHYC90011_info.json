    "overview": [
        "Particle Physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter, and the fundamental forces of nature. The subject introduces modern elementary particle physics, with an emphasis on the theoretical description of the Standard Model of Particle Physics and its experimental basis. Specific topics may include basic group theory; parity and CP violation; global and local symmetries; non-abelian gauge theory; QCD and the quark model; running coupling constants and asymptotic freedom; spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism; the complete Standard Model Lagrangian; interactions of particles with matter; accelerators and detectors; deep inelastic scattering and structure functions; flavour mixing and neutrino oscillations."
