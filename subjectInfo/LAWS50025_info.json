    "overview": [
        "This subject explores a core area of private law: the law of torts. It builds upon skills introduced in the foundational subject, Legal Method and Reasoning, with respect to the interpretation and application of both cases and statutes. The majority of the subject will focus on the tort of negligence. While traditionally a domain of the common law, the law of torts (especially negligence) has increasingly received attention from the legislature in all Australian states and territories. This area of law therefore provides an exciting and challenging opportunity to investigate the interaction (and, at times, tensions) between judge-made law and legislation. In addressing this interaction, students will consider the functions and objectives of tort law.",
        "Topics considered in this subject include:",
        "Aims and development of tort law in comparison to alternative approaches and statutory schemes;",
        "Trespass to land;",
        "Nuisance;",
        "Trespass to the person: assault, battery, and false imprisonment;",
        "Negligence, in detail (legally recognisable harms; duty of care; breach of duty; causation);",
        "Defences to torts: voluntary assumption of risk; contributory negligence;",
        "The allocation of losses including vicarious liability; and",
        "The calculation of damages (compensation) for personal injury."
