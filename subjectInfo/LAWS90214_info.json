    "overview": [
        "This subject will be taught intensively in Aotearoa-New Zealand.",
        "The subject aims to equip students with expert knowledge on current Indigenous legal issues in Aotearoa and Australia, including contemporary treaty Issues and the influence of Indigenous law in settler legal systems. Comparative perspectives on the ways in which Indigenous law is recognised, taught and practised will be emphasised. Students will be encouraged to think critically about the ways that settler law does and does not recognise Indigenous law and Indigenous law-making authority in these legally pluralistic countries. We will learn from Indigenous scholars and community leaders about strategies for asserting Indigenous law as part of self-governance, and the place of concepts of legal theory, legal traditions, sovereignty and territory in these debates.",
        "The focus of the subject will be on the following key areas of substantive law, including:",
        "Tikanga M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori law) in Aotearoa-New Zealand\u2019s legal system, and the law of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia.",
        "Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi) and agreement making between Iwi, hapu and settler governments, and Australian treaty-making processes and agreement making with traditional owner communities.",
        "The theory and practice of Legal Pluralism in Aotearoa-New Zealand and Australia.",
        "Special topics and contributions such as: cultural and intellectual property, Iwi governance, self-governance and nation-building, the negotiation and enforcement of treaties and treaty settlements, the impact of international law on Indigenous rights and law, and Indigenous approaches to agreement-making in the criminal justice sector.",
        "Indigenous students are strongly encouraged to apply for this subject, and the subject is open to all students that have an interest in Indigenous law. The subject aims to facilitate the building of a network of committed and talented advocates for Indigenous peoples and their interests."
