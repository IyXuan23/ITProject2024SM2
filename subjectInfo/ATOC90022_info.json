        "Semester 2 (Extended)"
    ],
    "overview": [
        "This subject will provide practical insights into the role of science and scientific thinking within a genuine workplace context. Students will be assigned a real world climate science problem identified by an industry partner, allowing the student to develop skills in project management, problem solving and planning, technical reporting, and/or applied science. The topic of the project is focused on a specific and defined industry issue, and applies knowledge gained in prior subjects to an applied problem of relevance to climate science.",
        "In addressing this task students will draw upon on their climate science knowledge and other skills developed in the professional tools subjects they have undertaken. On commencement of the project, students will be required to spend a specific time in the industry setting and to then maintain regular contact with the partner, as well as the project supervisor, across the duration of the subject. Depending on the nature of the project it may involve team-based work with other students or members of the industry partners team.",
        "Note: Only mid-year commencing students should enrol in this project part. Start year students should enrol in ATOC90018."
