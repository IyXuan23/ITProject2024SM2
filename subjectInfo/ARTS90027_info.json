    "overview": [
        "In this subject, students will undertake a project with an industry partner, individually or in smaller teams or a combination of the two modes of project management, whilst under academic and industry supervision. They will engage in project-based learning, refining the problem or topic presented to them, and proposing a project that is deliverable within a prescribed timeframe agreed in consultation with the organisation and supervising academic(s). Students will work closely with the organisation and undertake their learning in an immersive setting which challenges them to mobilise and enhance their knowledge and research skills to address contemporary industry challenges.",
        "As an experiential learning opportunity, this subject provides students with significant work experience and exposure to an industry partner aligned with their area of interest (Law, Public Relations, Advocacy, Art, Collections, Government, Corporates etc.). Throughout the subject, students will communicate their research and project findings effectively in a format of choice and acknowledge the limits and feasibility of the project stages. Examining the industry project critically, they will produce a portfolio or report and present the findings to an industry audience. Having engaged with an industry partner, they will be able to transfer their newly gained generic skills to problem solve in future and prosper in their chosen career.",
        "This subject is intended to provide students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge in a professional setting, under the joint supervision of an industry and academic mentor. Selection into this subject is based on academic merit, demonstrated motivation to benefit from the program and timely submission of an application as well as project specific rationales. The subject coordinator(s) will have final approval of all selected students. There may be further eligibility criteria as requested by the industry partner."
