        "In this capstone subject students apply their professional and creative methodologies to a final season of work.",
        "Students expand their understanding and experience of theatrical truth and character detail in different genres and theatrical styles, further developing their ability to inhabit the world of the play while contributing to, and working flexibly within, the director\u2019s vision. Strong ensemble skills are applied to different performance contexts and the rehearsal and performance of a public play under a professional director.",
        "In applying technical skills to advanced performance contexts and creative exercises, students develop a deeper understanding of the actor\u2019s process. The connection between the learning environment and industry expectations and practice completes the transition from student to professional actor."
