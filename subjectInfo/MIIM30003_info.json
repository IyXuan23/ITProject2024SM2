    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on the principles of immunology acquired by students in the pre-requisite subject MIIM30002 and provides a more detailed study of specific aspects of immunology. These include clinical and emerging areas in immunology such as: immune mechanisms that protect against pathogens and the implications for vaccine development and global health; immune system control and the diseases that may arise when that control is compromised; applications of immunology in organ transplantation; and immunotherapies to treat diseases of the immune system and cancers.",
        "This subject is delivered by specialist research-based and clinical immunologists, who are experts in these areas of immunology. They will discuss the experimental basis of our knowledge of immunology, how laboratory-based research has been translated into clinical practice, and future directions for immunology research and clinical application."

        "Describe the aetiology, pathogenesis and treatment of adverse immune responses occurring as a result of immune system dysregulation, such as occurs in autoimmune diseases.",
        "Explain how immunotherapy modulates immune function leading to improved outcomes for immune disease and cancer patients, and understand the risk of unwanted effects.",
        "Explain the immunological challenges of organ transplantation and how they are addressed.",
        "Interpret experimental evidence that supports exemplar immunological concepts.",
        "Integrate knowledge acquired throughout the subject and apply it to novel scenarios.",
        "Relate laboratory-based experimental results to translated clinical applications."
