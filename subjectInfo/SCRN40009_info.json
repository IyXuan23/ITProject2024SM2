        "We live in a world mediated by screen technologies, and our lives are marked by radical transitions and advances in media To what extent have they altered reality and our perception and experience of it? This subject analyses the nature of current screen media, including film, computer game, television, internet and mobile technologies and it explores their genealogies and material and environmental impact.",
        "Following an interdisciplinary approach, this subject will study the history of various screen media, asking how they mediate human and non-human experience of the world. It will examine their relationship with their audiences and their links with science and commerce on the one hand and art, entertainment and illusion on the other. This subject will investigate the concepts of embodied technology and the technologised body in the context of public, private, technological and environmental mediation."
