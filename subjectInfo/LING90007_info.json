    "overview": [
        "This subject adopts a language for specific purposes (LSP) framework to processes of language education. It begins from the premise that all language teaching involves the teaching of language for some specific purpose, and in some specific context. Working within an LSP framework, we look at a range of theoretical and practical approaches to needs analyses and to the design of programs and curricula. Approaches include corpus linguistics, genre theory, Systemic Functional Linguistics, and more socially critical approaches such as Academic Literacies. The subject will involve students collecting and analysing data (e.g. sample texts and interviews) to research the needs of learners and identify the discourses and practices of target communities in academic and professional contexts. Students will also participate in evaluating and developing LSP pedagogical materials and course curricula."
