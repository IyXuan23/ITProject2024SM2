    "overview": [
        "All students complete a foundation sports medicine theory & practice module Clinical Reasoning for Differential Diagnosis . Theory and practice of sports injury differential diagnosis is explored, including clinical reasoning strategies, hypothesis formulation & testing, clinical pattern recognition, and specific diagnostic and evaluative qualities of assessment tools. Students will scrutinise best practice within the different entities of sports medicine assessment: client history, physical examination, medical imaging and the relevant underpinning biomedical science. The role and influence of communication parallels the process of scientific evaluation, particularly in the attainment and conveyance of relevant assessment and diagnostic information.",
        "Students will then select 2 from 3 Stream Modules within which to integrate and apply this knowledge to inform an evidence-based, prioritised approach to sports medicine assessment and diagnosis.1.Assessment and Diagnosis of Function2.Evidence-based Assessment of the Spine and Peripheral Joints3.Athlete Illness",
        "The final Integration, Contribution & Reflection Module entails communicating pertinent assessment, differential diagnoses and the clinical reasoning explored in the Streaming Modules to hypothetical patients, and student-peers who represent the interdisciplinary team. Potential referral and management plans are formulated, focussing on justification and clinical reasoning. There is opportunity for interdisciplinary scrutiny, contribution and reflection."

This task can involve a quick quiz, reading a newspaper piece on a contemporary debate or reading a seminar paper on the subject.\r\nThese activities serve to familiarise the students with the online learning environment and prepare the students for commencing their learning fully informed about the requirements of the subject."
