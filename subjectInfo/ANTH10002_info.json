        "This introduction to anthropology will examine everyday experiences that we often give little or no thought to, showing that what we take to be common sense is anything but common. Centered on the getting, cooking, sharing and eating of food, this subject will introduce social and cultural anthropology as a discipline that celebrates human diversity, allows us to consider our place and potential in the world through critical self-reflection, and invites a deeper understanding of people\u2019s practices and beliefs. Drawing on written studies, anthropological film, and popular media from around the globe, students will be guided through key theories and methods in social and cultural anthropology, and they will be introduced to important debates within the discipline."
