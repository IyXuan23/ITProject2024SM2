        "The key focus of this subject is the foundations of systems analysis for designing and certifying learning-based and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for robotics applications. These foundations are based on the formulations and frameworks for the modelling and analysis of cyber-physical systems, such as the feedback interconnection of the physical robot, the noisy sensor data it uses to understand its environment, and the algorithm it runs to learn through exploration and to exploit its knowledge to maximise performance. The subject focuses on both existing applications of decision-making and learning algorithms to consumer and industrial robotics, as well as emerging applications of reinforcement learning and AI for robotics.",

            "The subject is designed and delivered using project-based learning pedagogies. Students in this subject two projects in small team, one of which is hands-on with a real-world robot. Lecture/lectorial sessions occur weekly, with the content in the first half of semester focused on implementation of AI methods, and the content in the second half of semester focused on theory that facilitates faster and more efficient implementation. Workshops occur throughout the semester to support the projects and practice the lecture/lectorial content. The workshop content transitions from guided upskilling with hardware and AI algorithms, to more open-ended project work.",
            "Students are provided with a functioning robot that has an accompanying wiki with documentation and tutorials for how to interact with the sensors and actuators of the robot. Lecture/lectorial and guided-workshop materials provide the framework and upskilling necessary to implement AI alogorithms for robotics, both in simulation and on the real hardware.",
            "The premise of the subject is gain hands on experience with cutting edge AI algorithms for robotics (e.g., Model Predictive Control (MPC) for nonlinear systems, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for continuous-space models. Moreover, the subject focuses on bringing togother students from multiple diciplines to work together with the strengths of each displince (Electrical Engineering, Mechatronics, Computer Science, IT), which is representative of industry team that graduates will be part of when working on AI algorithms for robotics applications. Additionally, industry guest are brought in to discuss how advanced AI algorithms are currently being deployed and developed in their sector."
