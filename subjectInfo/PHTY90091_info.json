    "overview": [
        "This subject will apply a problem-based approach to describe the physiotherapy assessment and management of individuals with acute and chronic cardiorespiratory conditions. Students will integrate prior knowledge of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology and pathology with theoretical and evidence-based knowledge to generate an effective and comprehensive physiotherapy assessment and management plan. A variety of teaching methods will be employed to develop students\u2019 skills in the assessment and diagnosis of cardiorespiratory problems. A range of cardiorespiratory physiotherapy interventions will be introduced, and students will be trained in the appropriate execution of these techniques and relevant outcome measures to evaluate their efficacy. Consideration will also be given to the rights of individuals and the impact of team management processes in cardiorespiratory physiotherapy practice. This subject includes 12 hours of clinical (generic) placement."
