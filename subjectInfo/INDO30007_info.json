    "overview": [
        "Students explore current issues in Indonesian society and further develop their linguistic abilities; topics covered may include democracy at work, religious disputes, other current events and a look at pre-independence Indonesia. These will be investigated through reading or viewing authentic material such as literary forms (e.g. short stories, poems) media reports, magazine articles, film & television clips. Students will undertake class discussions, presentations, essays and short translation exercises in order to consolidate linguistic resources gained in previous levels and develop a better understanding of complex and subtle language usage. At the end of this subject, students should have the linguistic resources necessary to begin tackling in-depth study of specific topics in professional and academic contexts using the Indonesian language."
