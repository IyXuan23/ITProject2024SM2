        "This subject introduces students to health services research, that seeks to identify the most effective ways to organise, manage, finance, and deliver high quality care and improve patient safety. This kind of research is more concerned with delivery and access to care in contrast to medical research, which focuses on the development and evaluation of clinical treatments. The aim of health service research is to increase understanding of the process, mechanisms, and effects of health services for individuals, families, communities, and populations in order to improve overall health outcomes.This subject paves the way for students to undertake health services research or to further appreciate the functioning of health services in clinical, management or policy roles.",
