During the workshop students will work in their project groups and do independent group work and facilitated activities, which aim to develop students' innovation and design thinking skills. Tutors will facilitate the workshop and provide guidance on each group's technology innovation project. This face-to-face teaching will be supplemented by online readings and recorded lectures provided on the subject LMS site, which will be updated throughout the semester. Students are expected to regularly review the content in the subject LMS and to spend approximately 20 hours per week on their group project, including attending classes and completing project activities outside of class time."
