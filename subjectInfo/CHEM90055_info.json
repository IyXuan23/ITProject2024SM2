        "An understanding of workplace safety issues is important for students pursuing careers in the chemical industry. This course explores the legal frameworks, current methodologies and issues of best practice in the risk minimisation and management of workplace hazards. The subject uses a variety of media in online delivery of course material and assessment, including recorded lectures, websites, videos and documented case studies, and builds on students own workplace experiences. It is anticipated that students will gain an appreciation of current legislation and codes of practice, identify different types of chemical workplace hazards and be able to apply risk management to workplace hazards."
