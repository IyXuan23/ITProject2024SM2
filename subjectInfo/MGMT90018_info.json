        "Businesses are collections of individuals who are organised and cooperate to solve problems. Thus, all business activity has its roots in psychological processes such as individual and group cognition and emotion, personality, and social influence. In this subject we explore the psychological foundations of management practice by focusing on how managerial problems (e.g., high levels of absenteeism; poor collaboration among team members; etc.) can be understood and addressed using different psychological principles."
