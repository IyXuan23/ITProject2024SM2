    "overview": [
        "Emergency nursing practice is characterised by a diversity of clinical presentations which range from those requiring minimal care to those with complex or life-threatening clinical presentations or injury. This variation in clinical presentation requires emergency nurses to have a strong foundation in patient assessment and pathophysiology knowledge. In this subject, students will clinically apply the theoretical principles from this subject and subjects, Applied Pathophysiology, Foundations of Critical Care Nursing and Emergency Nursing. Students will demonstrate the ability to undertake and support comprehensive patient assessment, monitoring and evaluation and care planning in specialty nursing practice. Students will learn to incorporate and apply scientific knowledge and evidence-based treatment and nursing interventions to support a patient-centred approach to inform their clinical decision making in practice."
