    "overview": [
        "This subject explores diverse scenes, sites and spaces of gender as they occur in contemporary life and culture. It will draw on key theories and approaches to gender to study sexual difference and sexuality in relation to real world contexts including culture, home, education, media, politics, public and private institutions, and the law. The subject will provide Gender Studies students with the opportunity to reflect on, expand and synthesize the rich skills base from the Humanities and Social Sciences which they have cultivated during their studies. Additionally it offers an essential forum for discussion about how these skills can productively be applied in the professional workplace. This includes a consideration of how having a background in Gender Studies will enable potential future leaders in the workplace to challenge and counter discrimination and prejudice, to institute cultures of change and to champion Human Rights. The subject will feature regular guest lectures by arts, community, industry, and public sector leaders."
