        "This 25 credit point subject is a capstone experience that will run over two consecutive terms. Building upon previous learning and the University of Melbourne graduate attributes, the subject provides opportunities to extend, deepen and apply knowledge, skills and attributes in the context of a research project.",
        "",
        "Students will be part of a research team and will work on aspects of a research project in collaboration with an experienced researcher . The student will communicate with the research team via synchronous online meetings and asynchronous discussions. This subject is an opportunity for students to integrate knowledge and research skills to develop, frame and address a research question. The research question can be answered by a systematic review of the literature, by an analysis of an existing data set or by testing a hypothesis within an existing research project.",
        "",
        "Students are required to select a project from a list of research projects made available to them. The subject coordinator in consultation with the research supervisor and student will determine the content and extent of the project.",
        "Students will be required to submit a report comprising a critical review of literature, methodological choices and rationale, results addressing the research hypothesis and discussion of findings and implications of the research project.",
        "This capstone also provides the opportunity for interdisciplinary networking; dissemination of project outcomes with student peers and colleagues; and peer review prior to submission of the final assessment task. Students will be expected to communicate their findings in a concise and scholarly manner to their peers.",
