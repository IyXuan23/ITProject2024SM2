In this subject students will explore the aims, principles, processes and techniques involved in business and domain analysis and the formulation of requirements. Topics covered will include: an understanding of the domain analysis problem; business and domain analysis; an exploration of methods for eliciting, analysing, specifying and validating requirements; requirements metrics; analysis techniques for \u2018special domains\u2019 drawn from a selection of enterprise systems, safety critical systems, usability and security.",

            "The subject comprises a two one-hour lectures and one hour workshop per week. The lectures are used to elaborate and interpret material and the workshops are designed to assist students in applying theory in their project and assignment work. The project forms a major component of the practical application of the subject and is used to focus a significant part of the teaching on a practical problem.",
            "INDICATIVE KEY LEARNING RESOURCES",
            "The subject is administered through the Universities Learning Management System (LMS). Templates for the various artefacts, guidelines on analysis processes and links to requirements analysis tools are available through the LMS. A standard environment is made available that includes modelling and diagramming facilities together with material compiled from a number of popular and current textbooks and available textbooks.",
            "CAREERS / INDUSTRY LINKS",
            "The software industry is expanding and along with it the demand for software engineers that are capable of the analytical and management skills beyond programming. The industry is also changing in the nature of the projects being undertaken with many software engineers now working in multidisciplinary project teams. The skills and experience gained in this subject are valued by employers and are often seen as a necessary grounding for a career in software and technology related industries.",
            "The subject provides students with a realistic environment in which to apply and learn the theory and practice of requirements engineering. Projects are chosen to reflect real-world considerations. Industry guest speakers are invited to provide lectures in relation to specialised project requirements."
