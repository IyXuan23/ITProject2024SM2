    "overview": [
        "This capstone subject involves an investigation and problem-solving project which will require students to apply a broad knowledge to realistic problems typical of what would be expected with employment in the environmental engineering industry. The subject revolves around the engineering education framework - CIDO: conceive, design, implement, operate, with the addition of 'monitor and evaluate'. Students will apply skills developed in other subjects to a single overarching project that will run through the entire semester, and demonstrate an ability to design sustainable engineering projects. Focusing on urban stormwater management, the project will require the students to develop a conceptual and quantitative model of a small-scale environmental engineering system (i.e. a biofiltration system). The students will then build and operate these systems and undertake monitoring and analysis of their behaviour to provide a critical appraisal of the original model. Having characterised the system, interpretation and evaluation of the impacts of a scaled up system on associated human and non-human stakeholders will form part of an evidence based report. Students will also be expected to critically evaluate the quality of their model, assumptions, data and analysis. The subject will be supported by specialised lectures and workshops."

Each week\u2019s lecture topic will reinforce previous learning necessary to complete that phase of the project work. Workshops will be run as consultation sessions to allow students to seek assistance with project implementation, and interpretation and write up of results.",
