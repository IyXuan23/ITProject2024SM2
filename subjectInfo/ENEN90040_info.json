        "It is widely recognised that we are now managing our water resources in a non-stationary world. Climate change is affecting the timing and volume of water supply and demands, but the scale of these impacts remains uncertain. How do we best manage our water resources given this uncertain future? This subject will provide an introduction to decision making theory under uncertainty. The subject will cover topics such as",
