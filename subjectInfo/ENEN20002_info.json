        "In this subject students will be introduced to physical earth processes and their engineering applications and implications. In particular, the subject concentrates on engineering aspects of climate, water, rocks and soils and their interactions. Simplified modelling and relevant analytical techniques are introduced throughout the subject. The students will learn about fundamental material required for later year subjects in civil, environmental and geotechnical engineering.",
        "The subject covers topics such as climate and seasonality; carbon cycle, global water cycle and catchment water cycle; rainfall, infiltration, runoff and evapotranspiration; catchment processes and stochastic rainfall modelling; Earth structure and composition; mineral and rock properties; geological processes; soil identification and classification; soil compaction."

Problem-based learning is a key feature aiming to enrich students\u2019 appreciation of the subject contents and their engineering relevance and practical applications. A hands-on exercise is conducted in a laboratory environment to quantify various constituents of soil and classify them with hydrological and engineering implications. The subject also allows students to develop their teamwork skills by collaborating on group assignments.",
