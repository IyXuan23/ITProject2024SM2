        "This subject introduces students in the third year of the Master of Youth Mental Health to the essential elements of the research process. The subject commences with learning content on the principles of practice-based research, as well as the ethical and legal issues of working with young people in a clinical research setting. The subject then progresses to the development of targeted research questions, the identification of appropriate research designs and methods, the interpretation of data and statistical analyses, and different types of research design.",
        "This subject will allow students to build on their existing knowledge and experience in youth mental health to formulate a research question, write a literature review, and draft a research proposal on a youth mental health topic of their choice. Students who are interested in carrying out their proposed research project will need to achieve a minimum H2A (75%) grade in order to progress to the elective,PSYT90109Youth Mental Health Research Project elective in Semester 2. Note that successful completion of PSYT90109 will equip students with a viable pathway to pursue a PhD in the youth mental health field."
