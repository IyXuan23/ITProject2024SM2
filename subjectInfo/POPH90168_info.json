        "This subject explores health and social issues for young people experiencing vulnerability. Specific groups of young people to be studied will be chosen from the areas: disability, indigeneity, homelessness, justice-system involvement, ethnic diversity, and sexual and gender diversity. The subject begins with a critical exploration of the concept of vulnerability as it applies to young people, and the use and purpose of such a categorisation by relevant services and through policy. The impact of risk and protective factors on adolescents\u2019 membership in a group experiencing vulnerability will be examined including those factors operating at individual, family, peer group, school and community levels. How vulnerability impacts the health and well-being of young people in these groups will be considered. Students will develop an understanding of the impact of multiple marginalities among young people experiencing vulnerability. This subject will discuss contemporary intervention approaches: most notably \u201cstrengths-based\u201d practice, as well as collaborative holistic approaches to service delivery. Students will be encouraged to explore innovative services relevant and accessible to the young people with whom they are currently working or would like to work with."
