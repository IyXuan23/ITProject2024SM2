    "overview": [
        "This subject allows students to develop skills in the synthesis of different classes of organic and inorganic compounds; analysis of samples with single and multiple components; determination of the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of molecules; measurement and interpretation of the spectroscopic and magnetic properties of inorganic and organic compounds. Students will have the opportunity to obtain expertise in the operation of modern analytical and spectroscopic techniques (including chromatography, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, mass spectrometry).",
        "The subject consists of a program of experiments supported by three lectures, two tutorials and a variety of electronic online resources. The lectures and tutorials, in addition to the electronic resources, provide background theory relevant to the experiments as well as instruction on different analytical and computational techniques, spectroscopic identification of unknown compounds and cover various aspects of chemical safety, reporting of experimental data, data and error analysis and the use of chemical databases."
