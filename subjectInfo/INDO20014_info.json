    "overview": [
        "Indonesia is well-known for its cultural, linguistic and religious diversity. Additional social groupings \u2013 both mainstream and subaltern \u2013 based on class, gender and sexual identities also contribute to the multifaceted character of Indonesia\u2019s social and political landscape. In this subject students will develop their knowledge and understanding of this diversity and how the interplay between local, national and global concepts of self and community impacts on the construction of contemporary Indonesian society. Through discussion and analysis of selected Indonesian academic and literary readings and other sources from electronic and popular media, students will explore the concepts of minority and identity, investigating selected cases that illustrate the construction of ethnic, religious, class, gender and sexual identities. Special attention will be given to the experiences of marginalisation and solidarity experienced by communities in Indonesian. This subject is conducted in Indonesian."
