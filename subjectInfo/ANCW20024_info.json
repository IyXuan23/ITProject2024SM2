        "This subject is designed for students who have completed Ancient Egyptian 3. In this subject, final work is undertaken on writing, grammar and syntax to revise, consolidate and complete students' knowledge of the language and its complex script, with the aim of enabling students to translate Egyptian hieroglyphic texts critically and independently. In particular, this subject focuses on a thorough overview of Egyptian participles and clauses.",
        "Students are exposed to increasingly difficult texts (most now consisting of multiple sentences) from a variety of sources. Background information on ancient Egyptian culture is woven into the subject matter throughout the semester. By the end of the subject, students should have a sufficient grasp of the language and script to read most literary and non-literary Middle Egyptian hieroglyphic texts solely with the aid of a dictionary and reference-grammar."
