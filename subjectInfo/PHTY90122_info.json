        "This year-long subject will focus on the application of research and its relevance to physiotherapy practice and the process of evidence-based practice. Research principles taught in this subject will be integrated and implemented into concurrent subjects in the Doctor of Physiotherapy program, including core physiotherapy clinical practice streams. Specific content in this subject will focus on exploratory, experimental, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, research design and methodology, incorporating ethics of clinical human research, statistical analysis and critical appraisal. Epidemiological constructs of prevalence, incidence and risk will be introduced in conjunction with applied clinical concepts such as number needed to treat and odds ratios. Qualitative research methodology, including critical appraisal and interpretation of individual perspectives of health and illness will be introduced, and students will be expected to plan, execute and analyse a qualitative interview of individuals' health perspectives. Clinical guidelines will be explored, including how they can be used to inform clinical practice and application of tools available for critical appraisal. Steps involved in developing a research proposal and strategies for incorporating evidence-based practice into daily clinical practice will draw together the curriculum in this subject and strategies for pitching and communicating a research proposal will be mastered."
