        "This subject examines the impact of modernity on the Islamic world: how have Muslims rejected, or adapted to, modernity? How have they shaped the terms of modernity itself? The subject explores the ideas of modern Muslim intellectuals and their attempts to respond to modernity as a \u2018Western\u2019 project while addressing critical issues facing the Muslim communities. Through a close study of Muslim texts, institutions, and socio-political movements, students will understand how modernity has shaped Muslim discourses as well as the challenges associated with constructing a \u2018Muslim\u2019 identity in today\u2019s modern world"
