        "This subject is available as an elective in many of the Faculty of Engineering and IT Masters programs. It is aimed both at students who have immediate entrepreneurial intentions and at students who may be considering starting their own business at some point in their careers. The subject is designed to introduce all participants to their potential as entrepreneurs. By developing their own enterprise proposal within small groups, students will learn and demonstrate various processes by which successful new ventures move from idea to launch."
