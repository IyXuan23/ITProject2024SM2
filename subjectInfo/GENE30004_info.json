        "The subject provides a capstone experience for students majoring in Genetics. It involves lectures and practical exercises which demonstrate advanced principles and techniques of genetic analysis from classical and population genetics to modern molecular technology. An emphasis is placed on student participation in experimental design and data analysis. Tutorials will be used to illustrate modern aspects of Genetics by the in-depth consideration of current publications in the field."
