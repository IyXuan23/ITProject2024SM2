    "aims": [
        "Students will undertake as individuals a high level investigative research project which could involve a critical literature review, experimental research and/or development, theoretical modelling, process simulation and/or the solution of an industrial problem. Rigorous planning and scheduling of the project, time management, technical communication, interpretation of results and team work will be required. Lectures will be presented on laboratory safety, and the use of statistical methods for experimental data analysis.",
        "This subject is designed for students who have demonstrated an ability to undertake a research project to a high standard and who wish to continue and extend the project to another semester. The subject is well-suited to students intending to undertake a research higher degree on completion of their Masters program."
