    "overview": [
        "Students and leading neuroscience researchers will discuss, debate and analyse research programs that examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural function in health and disease. In-depth consideration of these programs will examine what dictates the choices of model systems and the methods of analysis; what sort of technical and analytical skills researchers need to conduct their research; the factors that limits progress in the research programs, and what opportunities exit for the translation of research discoveries into therapies."
