    "overview": [
        "This is an elective subject in the Master of Public Health program that contributes to the Indigenous health stream and will be a foundation subject for those interested in working with Indigenous peoples. In this subject, students will be introduced to local and global concepts, frameworks and methods used by Indigenous populations to promote health equity and foster a global view of Indigenous peoples\u2019 health and wellbeing.",
        "International studies of the health of the world\u2019s almost 400 million Indigenous and tribal peoples provide important public health insights and data that can advance public policy, programs and health services worldwide. Taking into account the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Sustainability Development Goals, students will learn how to develop targeted policy and programmatic responses and take preventative action to achieve health equity for populations who experience poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous counterparts.",
        "Students will engage with Indigenous and tribal peoples from Australia and abroad on the development and delivery of key strategies to positively impact issues exacerbating poor health including poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, environmental degradation, prevalent infections and inadequate clinical care. Correction of these inequities requires a transdisciplinary approach including increased awareness and political commitment to understand and address these serious and complex problems.",
        "Students will learn from practitioners in the field how to tackle major difficulties and comparative studies will show how key globally recognised strategies have been implemented with Indigenous individuals, families and communities with a focus on community participation. The material in this subject is highly relevant in day-to-day public health practice in local and international development work, and key concepts can be applied to other populations experiencing marginalisation and vulnerability and disadvantage."
