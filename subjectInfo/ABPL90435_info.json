    "overview": [
        "Construction of commercial and high-rise buildings relies heavily on the use of reinforced concrete for its structural components. This subject introduces students to reinforced concrete systems and techniques for constructing commercial and high-rise buildings. Students will be taught how to interpret information provided by the engineers\u2019 reinforced concrete drawings and specifications that provides the necessary means to be able to transfer documented details into the physical built form. Students will investigate structural design concepts, structural behaviour and construction methods for reinforced concrete structural members. This includes reinforced concrete frames including slab and beam systems, prestressed concrete design concepts and introduction of hybrid wall construction systems and construction methods. Other related topics include exposed concrete surface finishes, sprayed concrete technology, concrete detailing and constructability."
