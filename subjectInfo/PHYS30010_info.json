        "Advanced Human Physiologybuilds on foundations of second-year Physiology to provide students with a more robust understanding of some key body systems and physiological concepts. The subject will focus on integrating concepts and synthesizing ideas to tackle challenging Physiological questions related to various clinical and functional  scenarios. Students   are encouraged to work in self-organised groups  to  complete progressively through semester  questions that aid in conceptual understanding and that contribute to the foundation for assessment components of the subject.",
        "This subject will provide the foundation for other third-year offerings in Physiology including pre-requisite content requirements for Clinical and Translational Physiology. Face-to-face learning and teaching sessions represent a blend of traditional information presentation, polling with formative feedback and discussion, and workshop and other active-learning activities."
