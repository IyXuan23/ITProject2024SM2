        "The subject aims to provide knowledge about engineered materials, their properties, manufacturing processes and key issues associated with their applications in engineering. The subject also introduces the relationships between the structure of a material and its properties.This subject provides an introduction to modelling the stresses and deformations that occur when axial, torsional and flexural loads are applied to materials in static equilibrium.This subject must be taken early in the progression of training to be an engineer as it is a prerequisite of structural design subjects, and contributes valuable insights into the role of materials in other disciplines of engineering such as geotechnical engineering.",
