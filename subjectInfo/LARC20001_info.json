    "overview": [
        "Designing Living Systems examines the contemporary use of plants, soils and animals as biological materials and ecological systems for construction. Designing habitats for people and wildlife requires learning and applying a variety of ecological principles across scales. It requires learning about what makes up living systems including soil ecosystems, plants and their interactions, animals, food webs, water, and sunlight. Students will develop their own design language emphasizing form, aesthetics, and ecological function to shape spaces for plants and animals as living material. Students will learn about organisms, habitats and ecosystem structure and function across a range of natural to anthropogenic environments. You will also land uses, building types and occupancy, as well as to consider the history and development of urban areas and their social structure.",
        "The interdisciplinary course includes experts from allied disciplines providing lectures and seminars alongside practitioners running tutorials guiding students in planting and ecological design. The subject builds on theories, principles and practices introduced in Natural History and focuses on design applications through assignments"
