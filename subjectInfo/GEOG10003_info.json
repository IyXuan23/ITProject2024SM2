    "overview": [
        "This subject asks students to reflect on their position in the world through discussing the links between their own lives and those of young people in other global contexts. Students use personal reflection and selected scholarly readings, videos and media reports to investigate how youth are responding to global opportunities and threats in widely different settings, with specific reference to issues of education, work, and politics. Students also think about strategies for strengthening discussion of youth across geographical and social boundaries. The course is driven by student-centred learning activities and is centrally concerned with issues of diversity and inequality."
