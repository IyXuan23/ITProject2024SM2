    "overview": [
        "In this subject, students prepare for globally engaged futures in the next stages of study or work by learning from and about Indonesian perspectives on the world. The subject gives students the opportunity to integrate their knowledge of Indonesian culture and society, apply this to new topics and challenges, and enhance their skills in intercultural communication and collaboration. Students are expected to identify and analyse the global and local intersections of pressing contemporary issues such as social inequity, the rise of digital technology and the causes and impact of climate change, and propose suggestions for further research and real-life action. The subject offers workshops by university staff as well as guest lectures by professionals from Australia and Indonesia. Students also explore or work with relevant university libraries and communities, institutions and festivals in both countries. As well as having a written report component, projects are developed, disseminated and celebrated through workshop discussion, blog presentation and a concluding student conference with panels and discussants. The subject is offered in English."
