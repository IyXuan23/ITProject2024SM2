    "overview": [
        "In this subject, students will develop an understanding of research in education, as the first part of their capstone experience, and advanced skills to analyse complex educational problems and the bodies of knowledge associated with them. Students will undertake coursework focusing on: what constitutes research in education; the function of a literature review; common methodologies and methods in education research; key issues in research ethics; the management and analysis of data; and the fundamentals of research writing. Students will develop insight into common approaches to research in education and will consider how principles of research can inform professional practice. They will develop the research skills to justify and interpret educational research propositions and the findings from educational research. This subject provides students with an understanding of research principles and methods applicable to education practice or policy, and focusses on the use of research to inform and improve education practice."
