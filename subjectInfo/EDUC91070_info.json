    "overview": [
        "This subject will support Teacher Candidates to make decisions about responding to children\u2019s learning needs using evidence-informed approaches. Teacher Candidates will explore the science of learning and its relationship to effective, culturally informed teaching and learning strategies. To support children\u2019s participation, Teacher Candidates will identify and respond to behaviours of concern and the contexts in which they emerge. Teacher Candidates will understand the historical and contextual factors in which language and communication are embedded and develop strategies to support the language and communication needs of children. The processes that underpin the successful development of literacy and numeracy will be explored, including identifying the literacy and numeracy needs of children and how to intervene using children\u2019s strengths and capabilities.",
        "The Clinical Teaching Model will be used to assess, plan and develop interventions for children with disability and diverse learning needs. Teacher Candidates will examine the importance of parent/carer involvement in education and how to work effectively with colleagues, other professionals and the community.  This subject will also support Teacher Candidates\u2019 explorations of classroom communication and management practices and strategies that support children\u2019s wellbeing and safety to provide high-quality inclusive learning environments that meet school and/or system, curriculum and legislative requirements. It will equip Teacher Candidates with the fundamental skills necessary to begin to observe, design and implement teaching strategies to engage all children. This subject references the relevant Australian educational frameworks and curricula.",
        "This subject includes a Clinical Teaching Practicum (placement) in a Primary school setting. During the placement, Teacher Candidates will demonstrate the nexus between theory and the practice of teaching, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and contemporary research to support their teaching practice. Teacher Candidates are supported by experienced Clinical Specialists and Mentor Teachers. A series of seminars will be held which explore Candidates\u2019 developing professional knowledge, practice and engagement. In this subject Teacher Candidates will also complete the Assessment for Graduate Teaching (AfGT)."
