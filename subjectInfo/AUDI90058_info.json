    "overview": [
        "This subject builds on Sound and Innovative Solutions A exploring hearing devices, communication strategies and alternative rehabilitation solutions. Students will gain an understanding of patient-centred practices, gaining an understanding of the complex rehabilitation options available. Throughout the subject, students will work through cases in workshop-style classes, allowing students to explore the different aural rehabilitation options available and tailor the technology and settings to be specific to individual needs. By the end of this subject, students will be able to create, perform and evaluate individualised rehabilitation solutions for clients."
