    "overview": [
        "The key aim of this capstone subject is to prepare students for evolving physiotherapy practices. Building upon previous learning and the graduate attributes, the subject provides opportunities to extend, deepen and apply knowledge, skills and attributes in the context of physiotherapy professional practice.",
        "Emphasis will be placed on investigating, analysing and synthesizing complex information, evidence-based practice and professional ethics, academic writing, critiquing, debating and weighing priorities relating to collaborative professional practice. To further build and enhance skills, knowledge and attributes necessary for advanced practice as physiotherapists, students will be given opportunities to be reflective, critical and creative in addressing identified needs in their own professional practice and in a professional practice setting. This will include development of their leadership skills through knowledge of leadership theory and the study of leaders in physiotherapy, health practice, health education and other professional domains. It will encourage students to explore and understand leadership styles including personality and emotional intelligence and how these impact on leadership and management. Students will analyse how power influences health and educational institutions and settings, how decisions are made and synthesize strategies to influence resource allocation. Skills required to manage allied health assistants and teaching students, mentoring junior staff, project management skills to facilitate coordination of activities such as quality assurance and in-service programs and advocating for physiotherapy will be developed. Management skills include skills in negotiation, mentoring, team building, conflict management, and advocacy. In addition, this subject will enhance private practice business skills, marketing and strategic management, and developing business plans, finance skills such as budgeting, engaging with Medicare and other compensable bodies, and facilitating and managing change within a variety of contexts. Additionally, they will draw on their previous learning in the application of evidence based physiotherapy to professional practice contexts and an ability to identify practice gaps, synthesize physiotherapy research evidence and critique this evidence.",
        "The subject will culminate in the opportunity to conduct a professional capstone project to apply their knowledge and skill in a professional context. Selecting a priority area in collaboration with a mentor, they will design, justify and present a program, service or resource, including a business case, to address the identified needs of the professional context"
