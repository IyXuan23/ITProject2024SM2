    "overview": [
        "This subject is an introduction to the field of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, building on 1st year chemical principles relating molecular structure to biological function. The content includes a detailed introduction to the structure of biological building blocks (amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids). The subject covers the structure and function of proteins, including the properties of enzymes, their regulation and kinetic behaviour. How nucleic acids replicate information, are maintained and repaired and serve as a template for the synthesis of RNAs and proteins (i.e. molecular biology) is addressed. The structure of lipids is examined to show their major biological roles, particularly as components of cell membranes. Metabolic pathways (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogen metabolism, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) will complete this core coverage of essential biochemistry. The subject is a prerequisite for lecture-based level-3 subjects in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The subject is designed to stand alone, but it complements the laboratory experiences in the subject BCMB20005 \u201cTechniques in Molecular Science\u201d, Each of these level-2 subjects can be taken independently, concurrently or in either order."
