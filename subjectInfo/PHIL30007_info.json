    "overview": [
        "This subject examines the nature of philosophy itself.  Students will read what many great philosophers have said about the methods, aims, and ambitions of philosophy.  They will examine how these views have been applied in thinking about various areas of philosophy, e.g. metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ethics.  The subject provides the opportunity to reflect on different strands in the philosophical tradition, which inspire conflicting projects in contemporary philosophy.  It should also encourage students to reflect on the nature and methods of the philosophy they have studied to date.  The subject is intended for students nearing completion of a philosophy major."
