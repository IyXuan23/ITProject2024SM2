        "AIMSThis subject introduces students to the fundamental concepts of structural dynamics and finite element modelling and teaches students the skills of undertaking structural analyses which involve dynamic (or transient) actions in a practical engineering context. At the conclusion of this subject students should be able to undertake dynamic analyses by hand calculations (that can be enhanced by the use of EXCEL spreadsheets) and effectively employ a commercial computational package (e.g. Strand 7) for more complex analyses. Emphasis is on the ability to undertake independent checks of results generated by the computer. Improved proficiencies in structural dynamics and modelling will result in more economical design of structures and a more sustainable built environment. This subject builds on students\u2019 fundamental knowledge of engineering mathematics, mechanics and structural analysis. For students considering a career in structural design for earthquake resistant structures this is an important subject to prepare for professional practice as a graduate under the supervision of a chartered engineer.",
        "INDICATIVE CONTENTTopics covered include: introduction to finite element formulations for in-plane (membrane) stress analysis, use of finite element modelling packages; the response analyses of single-degree-of-freedom systems, discrete multi-degree-of-freedom systems and distributed mass (continuous) systems in conditions of natural vibrations and forced excitations; numerical time-step integration techniques; excitation simulation techniques, simultaneous equation solution and reduction techniques; frequency domain analyses and processing of time-series data. Skills acquired from the various topics outlined above will be integrated and applied to a number of case studies."
