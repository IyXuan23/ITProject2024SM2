        "This subject provides students with further opportunities to put into practice the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier subjects in this course and extends their practical experience gained through Professional Psychology Placement 1. Students will be given further opportunity to engage with simulated client interactions and role-plays, and they will also be given the opportunity to practice their skills with patients in a variety of clinical contexts under the supervision of a registered psychologist. They will also receive training in the delivery of psychology services via telehealth modalities. To complete the subject students will investigate an individual research question relevant to professional practice and submit a written report of a case study including assessment, formulation, literature review, tailored intervention, and outcome monitoring."
