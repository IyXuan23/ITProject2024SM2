    "overview": [
        "Science and technology are at the heart of many of the most pressing legal and social problems of our day: climate change, war, disease prevention, state and corporate surveillance, \u2018post-truth\u2019 politics, the Uberisation platformisation of everything, and AI. Likewise, legal institutions rely heavily on scientific claims for their legitimacy and technical innovations for their social and political effects.",
        "This subject takes a critical look at these dynamics, using both historical and contemporary examples to explore the complex relations between law, science and power.In doing so it asks: How do scientific discoveries and their technological applications shape our social and legal worlds? And how do law and society affect scientific and technological developments in turn?",
        "The overall aim is to equip students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds with the analytical and critical tools necessary to understand and respond to complex questions of science and technology in all their legal, social, political, ethical, and cultural dimensions."
