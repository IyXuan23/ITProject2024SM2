    "overview": [
        "This subject focuses on the implementation and completion of a self-study/action research project. During the subject, students will use a researcher\u2019s journal to document and scaffold their research process. Through a multimodal presentation, students will share their preliminary analysis with peers and staff to collaboratively consider their data and research in preparation for the final write-up of their research. On completion of this subject, students will have completed a self-study/action research project and understand research processes that can be utilised to improve and inform practice and policy throughout the field.",
        "As part of the overall Graduate Certificate in Early Childhood Research course, students will participate in a Collective (small group of students) with a Collective Mentor (staff member/lecturer). The Collective serves as a consistent support for the student throughout the course and in relation to this subject."
