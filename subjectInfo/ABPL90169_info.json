        "This subject is the culmination of each student's studies in Master of Architecture. It will consist of a number of studio groups offering a range of opportunities for students to demonstrate an original approach to design synthesis, in architecture which is based on research and critical thinking. These studios will allow opportunities for self-directed research inquiries/projects.",
        "Students will be expected to demonstrate mastery of design resolution, conceptual engagement and aesthetic expression. Students will also be required to demonstrate a range of professional competencies defined in the National Standard of Competency for Architects (NSCA)."
