    "overview": [
        "The actions and activities of international organisations have been much scrutinised in recent years. This subject will focus on the law common to international (inter-governmental) organisations in order to understand the complex legal framework which governs their work. It will critically analyse the features of such organisations in light of recent practice and case law, with a particular emphasis on issues that have arisen in the major global inter-governmental institutions (for example, the United Nations) and regional organisations (for example, the European Union and ASEAN). The subject will highlight recent controversies in international organisations to illustrate the application of the law to complex factual situations.",

Alison Duxbury is a Professor at the Melbourne Law School and an Associate Director of the Asia Pacific Centre for Military Law. Alison's major research interests are in the fields of international institutional law and human rights law.",
