    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces PhD candidates to a range of art theories and art historical methodologies that remain available and relevant from the past, but that have been updated and critiqued in more recent times. It is also concerned with newer perspectives and trends. The subject will also introduce students to topics in the broader history of ideas or critical theory. Where possible, the class may feature in-class conversations with guest experts who will present an overview of their research experience and methodological shifts. Proposed texts will include selections from the works of major art theorists and historians, including Georges Bataille, Judith Butler, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Georges Didi-Huberman, Sigmund Freud, Michael Fried, Martin Heidegger, Laura Mulvey, Meyer Schapiro, Alois Riegl and Aby Warburg."
