        "This subject examines the use of macroeconomic models in economic policy analysis. The overall aim of the course is to discuss system approaches to estimating the macro-economy. Special attention will be paid to the SVAR and DSGE approaches and the relationship between them. The course will also include a discussion of optimal and unconventional policies. Topics include: impulse response functions, policy multipliers; policy simulation techniques and sensitivity analysis of economy-wide models. Applications to Australia will also be discussed."
