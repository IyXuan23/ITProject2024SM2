    "overview": [
        "This is one of the compulsory subjects in the Master of Public Policy and Management and as one of the final subjects will draw upon the key theoretical and analytical perspectives and debates introduced in the core subjects. There have been widespread changes to the nature and operation of public sector activity around the world over the last few decades and these have posed significant challenges and opportunities for public sector managers. This course provides a forum to debate, interrogate, and analyse these challenges through a series of structured managerial dilemmas (i.e. cases). Complex public service environments in Australia and internationally are examined, particularly the trends in public management reform, the underlying political ideas, and the impacts on policy and practice. The subject focuses on the implications of these changes for the design and delivery of public services, the role and functions of public managers and their relations with politicians, non\u2013governmental actors and the public."

        "Using the latest research provide advice to steer organisations in unfamiliar contexts towards desired outcomes",
        "Confidently and assuredly work with complexity in terms of information and managerial contexts as detailed in case studies to determine how public managers can best achieve their objectives",
        "Clearly and persuasively communicate to diverse audiences, particularly high\u2010level government delegations with an awareness of cultural norms and sensitivities."
