        "Intensive French 3 and 4 is designed to provide students with a systematic revision and consolidation of the essential structures of French. Classes will present grammar, syntax, and vocabulary in meaningful situations. The subject also stresses the productive aspect of language use in practical situations, while extending grammatical and lexical knowledge and refining oral skills. Listening skills are also developed by use of authentic documents. Students will also spend time in private study working on written and oral exercises and using online resources. On completion of the subject students should be able to sustain conversations and express opinions on topics of general interest, have consolidated their knowledge of all basic structures of French, and have attained level B1 of competence in the Common European Reference Framework in the target language."
