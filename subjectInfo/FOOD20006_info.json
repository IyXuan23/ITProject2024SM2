        "Microbes (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites and other agents) can be associated with food in several ways:",
        "As components of the fermentation processes that are associated with the development of flavours and textures of food and its preservation",
        "As the normal microflora that is associated with the origins of the food and persist during storage, possibly contributing to food spoilage",
        "As contaminants that enter food during processing or through subsequent mishandling, often posing public health risks",
        "However, as foods must be safe and fit for human consumption, this subject aims to familiarise students with major food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.",
        "The content will cover:",
        "The kinetics of bacterial growth and the factors that may alter this (water activity, low pH, temperature, preservatives)",
        "The principles of modelling growth",
        "The principles of hazard and risk assessment in microbiological safety",
        "The role of microbes in food processing, including examples of specific fermentation processes and waste treatment",
        "Practical exercises and case studies will be undertaken to provide an in-depth understanding of the regulatory framework of food safety"
