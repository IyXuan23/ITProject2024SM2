        "The United Nations (UN) is probably the boldest experiment in international relations in the modern era. It is a body of critical importance in the international political and legal arena, particularly with respect to its primary purposes of maintaining international peace and security; maintaining friendly relations among nations; facilitating international cooperation and providing a centre for harmonising the actions of nations in achieving these common ends.",
        "This subject aims to give students an understanding of the UN's role, structure and operation, from both a legal and a practical standpoint. To this end, the subject will examine the law and operation of the UN with reference to relevant case studies. These case studies will be used as examples to illustrate the successes and failures of the UN since its inception, and as a basis for examining the challenges that the UN may face in the future.",
