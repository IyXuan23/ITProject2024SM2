    "subject name": "Comparative Corporate Insolvency Law",
    "subject code": "LAWS90112",
    "subject availability": [],
    "overview": [
        "This subject provides a comprehensive analysis of corporate insolvency law from a functional and comparative approach, with a particular focus on the insolvency and restructuring frameworks existing in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, the European Union, and various emerging markets and developing economies from Asia, Africa and Latin America.",
        "It will be shown that, despite the legal, economic and institutional differences existing among countries, most insolvency systems seek to solve similar economic problems and they often use similar strategies to address those problems. Those strategies include the use of a moratorium, the availability of rescue financing, the existence of special rules for executory contracts and the approval of reorganisation plans, the avoidance of pre-bankruptcy transactions, and the imposition of special directors\u2019 duties and liability in insolvency.",
        "This subject will also examine the treatment of micro- and small enterprises in insolvency as well as the challenges, problems and solutions to deal with situations of cross-border insolvency and multinational corporate groups. We will conclude by providing a critical assessment of the Australian insolvency system.",
        "Principal Topics will include:",
        "The role and goals of corporate insolvency law",
        "Debtor-friendly and creditor-friendly insolvency systems",
        "The design of insolvency proceedings and the rise of workouts and hybrid procedures",
