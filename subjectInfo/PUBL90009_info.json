    "overview": [
        "This subject introduces students to advanced aspects of editing for digital media. It focuses on the strategic decision-making of editorial practice as well as the systems, trends and technological developments taking place in the digital media industries. It connects theory and practice in a deliberate and reflexive way, establishing the link between the University and your future careers in publishing, creative writing, media creation, and marketing. Taking the creative industries as its professional context, it explores multi-platformed editorial approaches; principles of workflow, budgeting, and monetisation; software for authoring, editing, content management and content marketing; and the creation of text, audio, and video for the internet. Students will gain a practical understanding of a range of applications and systems that are industry standards and develop deeper literacy around digital media and communication through the creation of a multi-platform editorial plan."
