    "overview": [
        "In this subject students will improve their cultural literacy in German by engaging with the topic of \u201cMyth\u201d from different perspectives. Myths represent historically and culturally significant events that are of great relevance for the societies they evolve in. Students will engage with a variety of myths through different media: they will develop more advanced reading skills by working with authentic material such as literary and journalistic texts and further improve their listening skills through the use of audio-visual and digital media. The written and oral analysis of these media will create an in-class discourse throughout the semester that allows students to improve communicative skills in relation to contemporary and historical issues and expand students' proficiency in both written and spoken language. They will learn to use more complex grammatical structures and develop terminology typical for academic texts and discourses."
