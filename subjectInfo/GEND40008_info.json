    "overview": [
        "This subject reviews the core texts and key debates that have shaped queer theory. We will trace the expansion of the term \u201cqueer\u201d from its early inceptions to its current use as an umbrella framework for non-normative modes of knowledge, cultural practices, and forms of political activism.",
        "After exploration of the key texts in queer theory we will focus on the relationship between queer theory and other social theories that provide tools for scrutinising power, normativity, and marginality such as: critical race theory, feminist theory, transgender studies, and disability studies. We will be asking the following questions: What kinds of bodies or desires does queer refer to? What are the promises of queer theory? What are the debates between \u201cqueer of colour\u201d, \u201ctrans* of colour\u201d and \u201cwomen of colour\u201d? What are the key sites for queer activism today? What might the future of queer be like?"
