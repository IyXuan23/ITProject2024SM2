        "It is perhaps obvious that human behaviour is having a negative impact on our environment. Behavioural change, thus, is pivotal to ensure a more environmentally sustainable future. However the question of behavioural change is vexed. Some argue that humans are \u2018naturally\u2019 greedy and selfish, others suggest that we are \u2018puppets\u2019 - the victims of the social structures engendered by capitalism, and yet others trust that good behaviour will follow from the \u2018truth\u2019; knowledge about environmental problems. These and other views of behaviour set up particular change strategies. The above examples suggest three strategies for changing behaviour: provide people with incentives that will lead them to \u2018choose\u2019 different behaviours, or the transformation of social structures such as capitalism and patriarchy, or the provision of environmental education.",
        "This subject examines the question of behavioural change from a number of disciplinary perspectives (psychology, sociology ecology, marketing and economics). Each discipline \u2018sees\u2019 the problem differently and this allows us to map insights and gaps in these knowledges. These purported differences can be understood and reconciled; behaviour is show to be a function of the physical, social and psychological aspects ofsocial practices. This allows for a more holistic understanding of behaviour and the strategies that might create behaviour change.",
        "NB:This subject uses a \u2018flipped classroom\u2019 mode of delivery. Most weeks require the watching of a vodcast prior to attending a 2 hour seminar. The success of the seminars and student learning is governed by individuals\u2019 preparation and participation. This subject covers a lot of theory and requires active engagement. The consideration of societal behaviour change will likely engender a consideration of your own behaviour, including as a student.",
