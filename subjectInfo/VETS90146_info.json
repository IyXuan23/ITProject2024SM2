    "overview": [
        "Building on the suite of pre-requisite Veterinary Professional Practice subjects, this subject continues the ongoing study of the principles of diagnostic and management processes. Students will be given opportunities to apply these principles in the context of a variety of species and disease states in practical classes and in concurrent subjects. Students will have the opportunity to develop enhanced skills and knowledge in their professional area of interest and will participate in work-integrated experiences in their chosen Track (Small Animal, Equine, Production Animal, or Government, Industry and Conservation Health). Students will be given opportunities to acquire proficiency in clinical skills to support their transition to clinical rotations and placements, and to reflect on their development of a defined set of entrustable professional activities. This subject equips students with skills to utilise legal and ethical frameworks in practice. It also provides careers training and equips students with the skills to enhance their strategies for optimising well-being through the Practitioner in Residence program. Upon completion of this subject, students will be equipped to commence clinical work-integrated learning at the U-Vet Veterinary Hospital and on clinical extramural placements."
