    "overview": [
        "Mind, Brain & Behaviour 1 provides an introduction to how we uniquely sense and perceive our world to construct our own internal psychological experience. The subject explores how we learn, think, remember, and operate within our constructed worlds; and explains the neural mechanisms that underpin psychological processes and experiences.",
        "The subject is designed to raise significant questions, prompting students to think about their own individual experiences and the experience of others. Students are introduced to the tools used in psychology to find answers to these questions. A common research-centred framework is adopted, and the methodological and statistical tools that support this framework are introduced and developed as an integral part of the subject.",
        "The subject comprises 4 topic areas: Behavioural Neuroscience; Sensation and Perception; Learning and Cognition; and Psychological Research Methods."
