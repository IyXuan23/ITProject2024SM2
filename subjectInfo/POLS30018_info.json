It analyses the policy-making of the EU and examines the tensions of nationalism and Europeanism in the attitudes of the member states and other participants in the integration process and especially in recent crises. The subject analyses the institutions and participants in the EU, including a detailed examination of the objectives and roles of the 28 member states and the benefits and disadvantages of membership for these states. It scrutinises EU policies, including the Common Agricultural Policy and the Euro; Foreign and Security Policy and Immigration. It further discusses the issues raised by the EU's crises, including the contested issues of protest, belonging and legitimacy and Europe's boundaries."
